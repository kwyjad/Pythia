        "description": "In 2024, France underwent a [political crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%932025_French_political_crisis) when President Emmanuel Macron called for snap elections. The [New Popular Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Popular_Front) (NFP) won the most seats in parliament (180), while Macron's centrist coalition, [Ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_\\(political_coalition\\)), won 159. [Cooperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_French_legislative_election#After_the_first_round) betweeen these two coalitions meant that [National Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally)'s coalition ended up with only 142 seats, despite getting the most votes in the election.\n\nSince no coalition reached the 289 seats needed for a majority, the elections resulted in a hung parliament. Macron refused to apppoint a prime minister from NFP, with the caretaker government remaining in place for 51 days. [Michel Barnier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Barnier \"Michel Barier\"), a member of [The Republicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republicans_\\(France\\)) (Republican Right) was then appointed Prime Minister. Barnier's government lasted for 3 months, until it was brought down by a vote of no confidence, the shortest tenure of any Prime Minister during the Fifth Republic.\n\nBarnier was then succeeded by [Fran√ßois Bayrou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Bayrou), the leader of [Modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Movement_\\(France\\)) (The Democrats) who remains the PM as of September 1, 2025, however, in late August, Bayrou announced a motion of confidence to be held on September 8, in order to seek parliamentary backing for his plan to cut public spending. National Rally, the [Socialist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Party_\\(France\\) \"Socialist Party (France)\"), the Greens and [La France Insoumise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_France_Insoumise \"La France Insoumise\") announced that they would vote against, which would effectively bring down the current government.",

        "fine_print": "The [official site of the government](https://www.info.gouv.fr/composition-du-gouvernement) will be the primary source of who is the Prime Minister, and the Interior Ministry will be the source as to which grouping they belong to.\n\nIf a National Assembly grouping changes name, this question will resolve as the former name.\n\nIf the PM belongs to a party and that party is part of a parliamentary grouping, this question will resolve as that parliamentary grouping.",

        "description": "Since the [1998 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Venezuelan_presidential_election) and the victory of Hugo Chavez, the United States and Venezuela have had a tense relationship, with numerous disputes over trade and foreign policy. During his tenure, Chavez often accused the United States of attempting to remove him from power, including an alleged assassination attempt and alleged support for the [2002 coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Venezuelan_coup_attempt). Following Chavez's death and Maduro's succession, tensions escalated further, as the United States imposed additional sanctions and travel restrictions on political leaders.&#x20;\n\nDue to the [2018 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Venezuelan_presidential_election), Venezuela entered into a political crisis in which the United States would declare the election fraudulent and [Juan Guaido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Guaid%C3%B3) the legitimate leader of Venezuela. During this time the US imposed harsh sanctions on Venezuela, backed protest movements and even supported an [attempt to capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gideon_\\(2020\\)) Maduro by private security forces. During this time Trump repeatedly [floated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_United_States_invasion_of_Venezuela) a full scale invasion of the country and refused to rule out a \"military option.\"\n\nDuring the Biden Administration, tensions slowly cooled, though the United States would continue to sanction Venezuela, and continue to declare Maduro's leadership illegitimate. In 2023, oil sanctions were moderately lessened as part of an [election related deal](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-opposition-sign-election-deal-paving-way-us-sanctions-relief-2023-10-17/). However following the [2024 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Venezuelan_presidential_election), tensions began to rise again as the United States once again declared the election illegitimate.\n\nAfter Trump's return to power, tensions ramped up quickly as the United States attempted to [deport Venezuelan migrants](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-receives-hundreds-deported-migrants-us-after-flights-restart-2025-03-24/), accused Maduro of [supporting criminal gangs](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article305820776.html), and [imposed further sanctions](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62zzv02r3vo). There was brief lull in tensions in July as a [prisoner swap](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/18/nx-s1-5472623/venezuela-prisoner-exchange-el-salvador-us) was agreed upon before a reversal where the US reaffirmed and increased it's [reward](https://www.state.gov/reward-offer-increase-of-up-to-50-million-for-information-leading-to-arrest-and-or-conviction-of-nicolas-maduro/) for the arrest of Maduro.\n\nOn August 18th, the United States ordered [several warships](https://time.com/7310889/trump-maduro-venezuela-militia-us-navy-military-deployment-drug-cartels/) to be deployed near the Venezuelan coast, Maduro responded by mobilizing over 4 million militia across the country and declaring there is [\"no way\"](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/venezuelas-maduro-says-no-way-us-can-invade-as-trump-deploys-naval-force) the US can invade Venezuela.",

        "fine_print": "Venezuela's territory includes territorial waters.\n\nTo qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Venezuelan territory or military forces: cyberattacks, warning shots in international waters, or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.\n\nIf it is disputed whether the United States is responsible for an attack, this question will refer to credible sources or may resolve as **ambiguous**. In case of an attack where there is no credible source consensus that it occurred within Venezuela's territory and neither the US nor Venezuela claims that it did, this question will not resolve based on that incident.\n\nIf an attack affecting both the US and Venezuela occurs, such as ship ramming incident, this question will resolve as **Yes**.",

What started as a collecting card game for children, has evolved into a passion for children and adults alike. In recent years, mainly during the COVID-19 pandemic, the hobby has garnered an even greater audience, causing increased demand for the printed cardboard.&#x20;\n\nSets of cards are printed in limited quantity for a limited time. Some particularly rare or interesting cards (e.g. cards featuring well known characters) have been [sold for more than 150,000\\$](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/53510751), with more typical values ranging [between](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/610516/pokemon-sv-prismatic-evolutions-umbreon-ex-161-131?page=1\\&Language=English) 100-1000\\$. Some have turned the game into a business, buying a large quantity of booster packs (containing random cards) from retail stores and reselling them for higher prices, or investing in specific cards, hoping their value will increase.\n\nOther sets released earlier this year, include *Destined Rivals* and *Black Blaze,* whose most expensive cards have values of 349\\$ and 433\\$ respectively, according to [tcgplayer.com](https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/pokemon/product?view=grid\\&productLineName=pokemon\\&setName=sv-black-bolt|sv10-destined-rivals\\&page=1) at the time of writing this question.",

        "description": "[Alina Habba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alina_Habba) is a New Jersey lawyer who first came to prominence as a lawyer for then-former President Donald Trump in [2021](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-lawsuit-new-york-times-alina-habba/2021/09/22/8acaf1c2-1bce-11ec-a99a-5fea2b2da34b_story.html). On March 24, 2025, after Trump retook the presidency, he [nominated Habba](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/trump-alina-habba-new-jersey-us-attorney.html) to serve as the Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, replacing John Giordano, who had previously been named the Interim U.S. Attorney on March 3, 2025.\n\nUnder [federal law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/546), Interim U.S. Attorneys may serve for only 120 days, unless they are confirmed as the U.S. Attorney by the Senate. Once the 120-day period expires, it falls to the local federal district court to appoint someone to the office. In Habba's case, the Senate did not vote on her nomination, and, on July 22, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey [announced](https://www.njd.uscourts.gov/sites/njd/files/StandingOrder2025-03USAttyAppointment.pdf) that, upon the expiration of her term, Habba would be replaced by [Desiree Leigh Grace](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/nyregion/desiree-grace-new-jersey-us-attorney.html), a longtime prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nGrace's tenure would be short-lived. Within days of the court's decision, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that [Grace had been fired](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-attorney-new-jersey-alina-habba-desiree-leigh-grace-pam-bondi/) and Habba re-installed, now as the Acting U.S. Attorney. At this time, President Trump also withdrew Habba's nomination to serve as the U.S. Attorney, so that she would be [statutorily eligible](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/3345) to serve in the \"acting\" role.\n\nFederal criminal defendants in New Jersey soon got wise to the situation and began filing motions to dismiss the charges against them, on the basis that Habba's appointment was unlawful. And on August 21, 2025, a federal judge [ruled](https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Brann-Habba-opinion.pdf) that indeed Habba's appointment was unlawful. The government quickly appealed, and an [expedited briefing schedule](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.125818/gov.uscourts.ca3.125818.10.2.pdf) was set, under which the appeal should be fully briefed by October 14, 2025. But in the meantime, federal criminal trials and hearings in New Jersey are at a [standstill](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/nyregion/new-jersey-federal-court-slowdown.html), raising questions about how long the status quo can endure.",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if, on December 31, 2025, Alina Habba is the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.",
        "fine_print": "Whether or not Alina Habba is serving in an interim or a permanent capacity will have no impact to this question.\n\nIf credible sources disagree as to who the head of the office is, the question will resolve according to the [U.S. Attorney's Office's website](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj).",

Since its discovery in 1976, periodic outbreaks have occurred mainly across West and Central Africa.&#x20;\n\nAccording to the [WHO](https://www.afro.who.int/countries/democratic-republic-of-congo/news/democratic-republic-congo-declares-ebola-virus-disease-outbreak-kasai-province), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) declared a new Ebola outbreak in Kasa√Ø Province on September 4, 2025. As of September 7, there have been 32 cases and 15 deaths associated with the outbreak.&#x20;\n\nDue to a vaccine approved in 2019, most recent Ebola outbreaks have been contained after a few cases. Prior to the current outbreak, the last outbreak exceeding 25 cases took place in Uganda in 2022. The last large outbreak in the DRC was the Kivu Ebola epidemic which sickened and killed thousands of people from 2018 to 2020. This question aims to estimate the eventual scale of the current outbreak.",

Deaths from Ebola occurring in other countries that are linked to this outbreak <u>will</u> count for this question.",

        "description": "Homework helper company Chegg at one point was so popular with students that it [became](https://www.theblueandwhite.org/post/to-catch-a-cheat) a verb: if a homework assignment became too difficult, you'd simply \"Chegg it.\" However, since the November 30, 2022 widespread rollout of ChatGPT, Chegg has faced massive disruption of its business model. From Reuters May 12, 2025: [Chegg to lay off 22% of workforce as AI tools shake up edtech industry](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chegg-lay-off-22-workforce-ai-tools-shake-up-edtech-industry-2025-05-12/)\n\n> Chegg said on Monday it would lay off about 22% of its workforce, or 248 employees, to cut costs and streamline its operations as students increasingly turn to AI-powered tools such as ChatGPT over traditional edtech platforms.\n\n> The company, an online education firm that offers textbook rentals, homework help and tutoring, has been grappling with a decline in web traffic for months and warned that the trend would likely worsen before improving.\n\nChegg's quarterly and annual reports can be accessed [here](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1364954\\&owner=exclude). In its most recent [quarterly report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000096/chgg-20250630.htm), Chegg had declining revenues, enormous accounting losses, and a dwindling cash position. According to the company:&#x20;\n\n> ...across our industry, there has been a continued increase in the adoption of free and paid generative AI products for academic support, and students are increasingly turning to generative AI for academic support, such as homework and exams, as well as assistance in other areas of daily life. This issue impacts education technology companies broadly, where students see generative AI products like Chat GPT and others as strong alternatives to vertically specialized solutions for education such as Chegg. These developments have negatively impacted our industry and our business and are expected to continue to impact our overall traffic and accelerate the decline in the number of new subscribers that sign up for our services, resulting in continued negative impacts to our growth, business, operating results and financial condition.",

The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed before that date, this question resolves as **No**.",

During the show, contestants are constantly monitored through several cameras and microphones placed around the house, with live feeds aired throughout the day. Over the course of a season, players compete in physical and mental challenges for prizes and powers, and each week, ultimately vote for another player to be evicted and to leave the game.\n\nThe [American edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_\\(American_TV_series\\)), first airing in 2000, spans 27 seasons, with the most recent season, [Big Brother 27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_27_\\(American_season\\)) celebrating the 25th anniversary. Premiering July 10, 2025 and set to end September 28, 2025, this season features a murder mystery theme, a \\$750,000 grand prize, and a record 17 players. As of September 1, 2025, 7 players have already been evicted.",

        "description": "[The Fide Grand Swiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE_Grand_Swiss_Tournament) is a large, Swiss-style chess tournament organised by FIDE every year, and forms part of the qualifying cycle for the Candidates Tournament - the top 2 players in the Grand Swiss qualify for the candidates.\n\n[The Tournament this year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE_Grand_Swiss_Tournament_2025) will take place in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, and will consist of 11 rounds of classical chess from the 3rd to the 16th of September 2025. There are 116 players qualified for the tournament - the top 101 rated players who accept their invitation, plus 4 continental qualifiers, 4 nominees from the host country, and 6 nominees by the president of FIDE.&#x20;\n\nFull tournament regulation [are here](https://handbook.fide.com/files/handbook/Regulations_for_the_FIDE_Grand_Swiss_2025.pdf).&#x20;\n\nThree results are possible in the game of chess: black win, white win, or a draw. In typical chess terminology, black or white wins are considered decisive results, whilst draws are not decisive results. Chess is thought to be a \"drawish\" game, with many observers finding the lack of decisive results, particularly at the highest level of chess competition, frustrating.&#x20;\n\nThe past three FIDE Grand Swiss tournaments had the following percentages/numbers of decisive games:&#x20;\n\n* [2023](https://www.fide.com/grand-swiss-a-look-beyond-the-individual-games-and-results/): 441 draws from 840 games (52.5% draw rate)\n* [2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/qpexh5/grand_swiss_data_and_closing_statistics/): 53% draw rate\n* [2019](https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?result=1/2-1/2\\&tid=105290): 320 draws from 594 games (53.9% draw rate)&#x20;",

This was significantly higher than Colombia's most recent CPI growth at the time of 5.2% (with the food component being 2.7% growth), so it represented a large increase in real terms.

If the Colombian government does not announce the minimum wage for 2026 before February 1, 2026, the question will be annulled. Any subsequent changes to the minimum wage after the first official announcement will have no impact on this question.\r\n\r\nThis question's resolution source will likely be the[ <u>Gestor Normativo portal</u>](https://www1.funcionpublica.gov.co/web/eva/gestor-normativo).

        "description": "On the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump signed [Executive Order 14169](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/): Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid, which [initiated](https://www.venable.com/insights/publications/2025/01/some-additional-guidance-on-trump-eo-pausing) a 90-day pause on new obligations and disbursements of foreign aid and assistance. Additionally, the US State Department issued a stop-work order for existing grants and contracts, which was shortly thereafter [reversed](https://www.devex.com/news/devex-newswire-in-victory-for-aid-sector-judge-reverses-usaid-stop-work-order-109396) by a federal judge. It also ordered a [widespread review](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9nx5k7lv0o) of foreign aid programs, due by the end of the 90-day pause, to ensure that foreign aid programs align with the Trump Administration's foreign policy goals. According to a State Department [press statement](https://www.state.gov/implementing-the-presidents-executive-order-on-reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/):\n\n> Consistent with President Trump‚Äôs Executive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid, Secretary Rubio has paused all U.S. foreign assistance funded by or through the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for review. He is initiating a review of all foreign assistance programs to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.\n\n> President Trump stated clearly that the United States is no longer going to blindly dole out money with no return for the American people. Reviewing and realigning foreign assistance on behalf of hardworking taxpayers is not just the right thing to do, it is a moral imperative. The Secretary is proud to protect America‚Äôs investment with a deliberate and judicious review of how we spend foreign assistance dollars overseas.\n\nAccording to an editorial at [Just Security](https://www.justsecurity.org/106876/us-foreign-aid-stop-work-order/) from the Reiss Center on Law and Security at New York University School of Law:\n\n> To be clear, there is no such thing as a temporary pause. When an NGO, a small business, or an American company that receives U.S. government funding to implement U.S. foreign assistance is told to stop work, even for 90 days, that means people are fired, expertise is lost, and programs are shut down with no guarantee they‚Äôll start back up, even if they survive the review.\n\nThe US federal government's fiscal year runs from October 1 of the preceding calendar year to September 30 of the following calendar year. For example, FY 2025 runs from October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025. In the past decade, foreign disbursements as a percentage of allocations have been as follows:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Appropriated and Planned | Disbursements       | Disbursements % of Appropriated |\n| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| 2023        | \\$44,673,242,150         | \\$71,930,165,748    | 161.01%                         |\n| 2022        | \\$43,990,720,437         | \\$73,956,218,596    | 168.12%                         |\n| 2021        | \\$42,739,422,430         | \\$48,772,467,446    | 114.12%                         |\n| 2020        | \\$42,784,665,322         | \\$46,923,470,923    | 109.67%                         |\n| 2019        | \\$42,886,881,765         | \\$46,586,078,509    | 108.63%                         |\n| 2018        | \\$42,994,435,979         | \\$46,591,873,333    | 108.37%                         |\n| 2017        | \\$44,229,939,946         | \\$45,370,133,765    | 102.58%                         |\n| 2016        | \\$47,551,386,270         | \\$46,884,529,391    | 98.60%                          |\n| 2015        | \\$48,938,387,821         | \\$48,546,177,859    | 99.20%                          |\n| 2014        | \\$41,731,239,076.00      | \\$41,864,770,825.00 | 100.32%                         |",

        "description": "[Prediction markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market) are exchange-traded markets established for trading bets in the outcome of various events. These could range from the [winner of the US presidential election](https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024) to [bird flu being designated a pandemic](https://kalshi.com/markets/kxnewoutbreakph5n1/new-bird-flu-pandemic) or [an AI winning the International Mathematical Olympiad](https://manifold.markets/Austin/will-an-ai-get-gold-on-any-internat). Similar to Metaculus, prediction markets harness the wisdom of the crowds to provide [accurate](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/prediction-market-faq) probabilistic estimates for future events.\n\nPrediction markets are tightly controlled in the US, with very few of them (e.g., [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/)) being approved by the CFTC. The largest prediction market as of the writing of this question, [Polymarket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymarket) was fined by the CTFC in 2022 and stopped offering access to US customers. Another large prediction market, [Manifold](https://manifold.markets/) allows users to bet almost exclusively using play money.",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if, in the calendar year 2025, Polymarket or Manifold can legally offer markets in the United States using real money.",
        "fine_print": "* This has to be legal in at least one US state.\n* A public change in law or government policy must occur for this to resolve as **Yes**, which could include but is not limited to court decisions, public CFTC [<u>no-action letters</u>](https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/CFTCStaffLetters/index.htm), executive orders, or new laws. For example, if Manifold or Polymarket were to decide to accept risk under the status quo, satisfying the other criteria with no preceding change in law or government policy, that would not be sufficient. In the event the circumstances are unclear Metaculus may resolve the question as **ambiguous**.\n* For the purposes of this question, real money includes anything that can be legally exchanged for fiat currency. For example, if Polymarket launched \"Polymarket chips\" that one could at any point legally both buy and sell using USD and it was legal to bet on Polymarket using those chips, this question would resolve as **Yes** (in the same way that gambling in a casino with chips is gambling with real money). Similarly any legal cryptocurrencies or crypto tokens (e.g., USDC) would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* If Polymarket or Manifold markets operate using a custom currency (e.g., Manifold sweepcash), to resolve as **Yes** they have to explicitly state that users can exchange fiat currency for the custom currency and vice versa. Manifold's workaround that gives \"free\" sweepcash for mana purchases does not suffice to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Polymarket or Manifold restricting withdrawals only to money that has been previously traded would *not* prevent this question from resolving as **Yes**. A restriction that would allow only money that has been won from a market resolution to be withdrawn, however, *would* prevent this question from resolving as **Yes**.",

        "description": "The federal budget process in the United States begins with the passage of a [<u>budget resolution</u>](https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation#how-does-congress-start-the-cbpp-anchor) ‚Äî a concurrent resolution passed by both the House and Senate that sets broad fiscal targets for spending, revenue, the deficit, and debt levels. While it provides a framework for the upcoming fiscal year, it does not become law and does not require the president's signature. Importantly, the budget resolution may include reconciliation instructions, which direct specific congressional committees to draft legislation that meets the resolution's fiscal goals. These instructions are optional but allow for the creation of a [<u>reconciliation bill</u>](https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation), which allows the Senate to pass certain budget-related laws with a simple majority vote and limited debate, bypassing the [<u>filibuster</u>](https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/filibusters-cloture.htm).\n\nIf reconciliation instructions are included, the resulting reconciliation bill must be passed by both chambers and signed by the president to become law. It can include changes to spending, revenue, or the debt limit, but is restricted by rules such as the [<u>Byrd Rule</u>](https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation#what-is-the-byrd-rule-cbpp-anchor), which prohibits provisions unrelated to budget changes. If the budget resolution does not include reconciliation instructions, Congress must enact any fiscal changes through the regular legislative process. In this case, changes to [<u>discretionary spending</u>](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/#the-difference-between-mandatory-discretionary-and-supplemental-spending) are made through the annual appropriations bills, which fund specific government departments and require presidential approval. Changes to mandatory spending programs (like Medicare, [<u>Medicaid</u>](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-much-of-the-federal-budget-is-mandatory-spending/), or Social Security), however, require standalone legislation that amends the law governing those programs. These also must pass both chambers and be signed by the president, and they generally face a higher procedural hurdle in the Senate due to the possibility of a filibuster.\n\nThe qualified business income (QBI) deduction, also known as Section 199A, was created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to provide tax relief to pass-through business owners. This provision allows eligible taxpayers to deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income from partnerships, S corporations, and sole proprietorships. The deduction is subject to limitations based on the type of business, the taxpayer's income level, and the amount of W-2 wages paid and qualified property owned by the business. Like other individual tax provisions in the TCJA, the QBI deduction is scheduled to expire after December 31, 2025. Business groups have been [<u>lobbying</u>](https://www.davisjournal.com/2025/05/06/531849/nfib-releases-report-detailing-effects-of-allowing-the-small-business-qbi-tax-deduction-to-expire) to make this deduction permanent, arguing that its expiration would effectively constitute a large tax increase on small business owners.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the [<u>House Ways and Means Committee marked up</u>](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Section-by-Section.pdf) its proposed section of the reconciliation bill. This legislation makes the QBI deduction permanent and increases the percentage value to 23 percent, from 20 percent. The [<u>Joint Committee on Taxation</u>](https://www.jct.gov/publications/2025/jcx-19-25/) has estimated that this will reduce federal revenue by \\$785 billion over ten years.",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as the legislated percentage value of the deduction for qualified business income (QBI) effective for tax year 2026, enacted as part of a spending reconciliation bill passed during fiscal year 2025. If no such reconciliation bill is enacted before the end of fiscal year 2025 (before October 1, 2025), this question will be **annulled**.\n\nThe question will resolve according to the text of the enacted reconciliation bill (See [<u>section 11011 of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</u>](https://www.congress.gov/115/statute/STATUTE-131/STATUTE-131-Pg2054.pdf#page=10) for an example of what this might look like).",
        "fine_print": "* This question is asking the usual percentage of qualified business income allowed to be deducted under the law. Under the 2017 law, this was 20 percent. There may be other restrictions or caps placed, but this will resolve based on the generally applicable percentage allowed as a deduction.\n* The deduction percentage used to resolve this question will be for tax year 2026, the first year under which the qualified business income deduction passed as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is due to expire under pre-2025 law. Any provision in the 2025 bill scheduling another expiration of the QBI adjustment, and any other changes legislated for years after 2026, will not be relevant.\n* Metaculus may use reports from[<u> credible sources</u>](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) for the bill text. In the event the bill text is not available within three months after the passage of the bill, or in the event it is unclear as to generally applicable percentage allowed as a deduction, Metaculus may use reporting and estimates from other credible sources to resolve this question.",

        "description": "[Lisa DeNell Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Cook) is an American economist and a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. She was first appointed to a partial term in May 2022 and later confirmed in September 2023 to a full 14-year term ending January 31, 2038.\n\nIn August 2025, [Trump attempted to remove Cook](https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-cook-trump-e9933d518af5155250bebbdc29fd3f2b) from her position alleging that she commited mortgage fraud before she became a member of the Fededral Reserve Board. Under the Federal Reserve Act, Governors serve staggered 14-year terms and may be removed by the President [only \"for cause\"](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section10.htm). Such a removal [has never happened](apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-cook-trump-e9933d518af5155250bebbdc29fd3f2b) in the Federal Reserve's history.\n\nAccording to the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-cook-trump-e9933d518af5155250bebbdc29fd3f2b):\n\n> Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed ‚Äî and its chair, Jerome Powell ‚Äî for refusing to cut interest rates. The central bank has left its benchmark rate unchanged this year, partly because it is waiting to see whether the big taxes ‚Äî tariffs ‚Äî that Trump is slapping on foreign products will push inflation higher. Cook has voted against a cut, along with most board members.\n\nLisa Cook filed a lawsuit to challenge her firing and the August court hearing [concluded without a ruling](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/hearing-ends-without-ruling-trumps-firing-fed-governor-cook-2025-08-29/), meaning that Cook would stay in place for now.",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Lisa Cook ceases to be as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors at any time before November 3, 2026 EST, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).",
        "fine_print": "In case of ambiguity, the [Federal Reserve page of board members](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm) will be used to resolve this question.",

        "description": "On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed [Executive Order 14169](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/) \"Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid,\" which put into motion a 90-day pause in US development assistance, in order to review programs to ensure their alignment with the foreign policy goals of the Trump Administration. On January 28, Secretary of State Marco Rubio [issued](https://www.state.gov/emergency-humanitarian-waiver-to-foreign-assistance-pause/) an emergency humanitarian waiver for some medicines and medical services. According to the [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-status-of-president-trumps-pause-of-foreign-aid-and-implications-for-pepfar-and-other-global-health-programs/):&#x20;\n\n> While additional waivers could be requested through the Director of Foreign Assistance at the Department of State, several activities are not eligible for waivers at all, including those that involve: abortions (which are not paid for using U.S. government funds anyway), family planning, conferences, administrative costs other than those covered by the humanitarian assistance waiver, gender or DEI ideology programs, transgender surgeries, or other non-life saving assistance. Some of these services are also the subject of other executive orders and actions issued by the President include (including [‚ÄúEnding Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing‚Äù](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/) and [‚ÄúDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism And Restoring Biological Truth to The Federal Government‚Äù](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/)).\n\n> Despite the emergency humanitarian waiver specifying life-saving medicine and medical services, it was still unclear what programs it actually applied to and whether it included services provided by PEPFAR, the President‚Äôs Malaria Initiative, and other health programs, since under the State Department‚Äôs [framework for foreign aid](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40213), health programs and humanitarian assistance efforts are categorized separately. As a result, the PEPFAR program applied for a specific waiver, which was [granted on February 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQgNTpC6F5oaOnkebQokJ_2eYgM_IcQNT7alIL6R3P16Ef4Z0pmQby3Y1eHbJcTxK_yJ8EPVNiibxON/pub), for certain activities. No other waivers have been announced for any other U.S. global health program, such as for the President‚Äôs Malaria Initiative (PMI), TB, maternal and child health, and nutrition activities.\n\n&#x20;\n\nFor FY 2025, the Senate version of the the appropriations bill [allocated](https://globalhealth.org/media/global-health-council-statement-on-senate-fiscal-year-2025-state-foreign-operations-appropriations-committee-markup/) \\$9.67 billion for health programs run by the US State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID). According to Stanford researchers in 2019, US spending on health programs [helped](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2019/05/foreign-aid-for-public-health-bolsters-americas-soft-power.html) to improve the nation's standing and influence.&#x20;\n\nThe US federal government's fiscal year runs from October 1 of the preceding calendar year to September 30 of the following calendar year. For example, FY 2025 runs from October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025.

This question tracks the outcome of FDEP's 2025 review.\n\n**From the city website:**\n\n> The Project Area is in Tiger Point. The work includes the construction of infrastructure to expand the treatment capacity of the existing wastewater treatment plant from 2.0 million gallons per day to 3.5 million gallons per day. The infrastructure includes constructing new oxidation ditches, water clarifiers, filters, and all other components necessary for a complete and operational wastewater treatment facility. It also includes the rehab and refurbishing of existing Bardenpho reactors to additional water reject storage tanks.\n> &#x20;\n> Bids were opened early 2024, and the bid was awarded April 2024.

        "description": "[Paul Biya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Biya) (born 1933) is the oldest head of state in the world and only the second president in the history of Cameroon, which gained its independence in 1960. Biya has been President of Cameroon since 1982, when the country's first president resigned and Biya, then prime minister, ascended to the office. In the decades since, Biya has regularly won reelection, in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1997, 2004, 2011, and 2018. (In 2008, the national assembly removed the term-limits provision from the constitution so he could continue to run.) The closest of these elections was in [1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Cameroonian_presidential_election), when Biya won with only 40% of the vote, not too far ahead of the second-place finisher, who attracted 36% of the vote. Since then, Biya has regularly trounced his opposition, amid allegations of fraud or electoral boycotts by opposing parties.\n\nBiya is again standing for reelection in October 2025. [Polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Cameroonian_presidential_election#Opinion_polls) in the months leading up to the election indicated that Biya was running third, slightly behind [Cabral Libii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabral_Libii) and far behind [Maurice Kamto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Kamto). On July 26, 2025, however, Kamto was [disqualified](https://www.hilltopvoices.com/2025/07/elecam-publishes-official-list-of-13.html) by the state electoral authority. [More recent polling](https://cameroonnewsagency.com/breaking-news-cna-poll-makes-startling-revelations-on-upcoming-presidential-election/) indicates overwhelming opposition to Biya's remaining in office but no clear coalescence around an opposition candidate. Biya faces several opponents in the race and needs only a plurality of votes to win.",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Paul Biya is officially declared the winner of the 2025 Cameroonian presidential election.\n\nIt will resolve as **No** if someone else is declared the winner of the election. If no winner is declared before January 1, 2026, this question will be **annulled**.",
        "fine_print": "In the event that the fairness or results of the election are disputed, this question will resolve according to the official pronouncements of the Cameroonian government.",

That would put the number EU countries who have recognized Palestinian statehood at 12, which is 3 countries shy of a majority.  If the EU reached a majority it will be a milestone and could be a sign the large economic bloc's approach to the Palestinian Question could change.\n\nSee also:\n\n* An overview of Trump trade deals and frameworks ([<u>here</u>](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/29/trump-trade-deals-details)).\n* The US has opposed countries recognizing Palestine.

These figures reflect crime levels, enforcement activity, and community trends. If the combined total remains below 450 for the year, it may suggest lower crime rates, successful prevention efforts, or changes in enforcement practices. This forecast asks: will the total number of arrests and warrants stay under 450 in calendar year 2025?",

        "description": "According to the [Migration Policy Institute](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/germany-eu-migration-crossroads):\n\n> Ahead of national elections next year, German officials are scrambling to show they have not lost control over migration and are addressing the public‚Äôs concerns regarding the rising number of arrivals. The poor performance of the ruling coalition parties and record support for the far-right Alternative f√ºr Deutschland (AfD) in several regional elections in September have engendered political panic in Berlin.\n\n> Germany has been heavily affected by recent refugee crises and now stands as the world‚Äôs third largest refugee-hosting country. Over just two years, Germany granted temporary protection to 1.2 million Ukrainians. The country also receives, by far, the highest number of asylum applications in the European Union, accounting for nearly one-third (334,000) of the claims filed in 2023. And like other Member States, Germany is grappling with a severe housing crisis and strained public services, amid unprecedented pressure on public finances. Regional policymakers have become increasingly vocal about the migration-related fiscal and service provision challenges.\n\nIn the past two years, the AfD has racked up a string of strong showings in some elections, such as in [Thuringia](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/europe/afd-germany-election-thuringia-saxony-intl) and [Brandenburg](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/27998/afd-vote-share-in-bradenburg-election-2024/). In February 2025 AfD [received](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/02/24/german-elections-far-right-afd-party-achieves-historic-result_6738495_4.html) 20.8% of the vote in the federal election, doubling its vote share from the 2021 election.&#x20;\n\nAt least 6 AfD candidates are reported to have died of various causes [according to the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ykyewrerpo), leading to some mail-in ballots having to be recast. German police quickly ruled out foul play, and the sudden deaths have sparked what the BBC called \"a flurry of conspiracy theories\" on social media ([example](https://x.com/TRobinsonNewEra/status/1962641820468559955)).\n\nRecent polling numbers are reported at [Polit-Pro](https://politpro.eu/en/north-rhine-westphalia).",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as the percentage of votes that Alternative for Germany (AfD) gets in the final results of the 2025 North Rhine-Westphalia local [elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_North_Rhine-Westphalia_local_elections).",
        "fine_print": "The local elections are scheduled for September 14, 2025. This question resolves based on the results of the voting on that day and will not account for any run-off elections that may in some cases be held two weeks later, as may be required for certain mayoral contests.\n\nThe question will be **Annulled** if the first round of voting does not take place before October 15, 2025. It will also be **Annulled** if less than 95% of the votes have been counted before November 1, 2025. If greater than 95% but less than 100% of votes have been counted before November 1, the question resolves based on the counted votes.",

[Subsequent agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_border_dispute#Timeline) in 1996, 2005, [2012](https://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/LegalTreatiesDoc/CH12B0194.pdf), and [2013](https://www.eoibeijing.gov.in/eoibejing_listview/ODM0) continued to build upon this foundation, establishing mechanisms for consultation, coordination, and confidence-building measures along the border. On May 5, 2020, Indian and Chinese troops engaged in a [clash at Pangong Tso lake](https://thediplomat.com/2020/06/blood-spilled-on-the-china-india-border/), marking the beginning of a series of confrontations. The situation deteriorated, leading to the deadly [Galwan Valley clash](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53061476) on June 15, 2020. Incidents continued to occur, including a [clash in January 2021](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55793112) near Naku La in Sikkim and[ another in December 2022](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63953400) in the Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh. In October 2024, India and China reached a [significant agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/world/asia/india-china-border.html) to ease border tensions that had persisted since the deadly clash in Galwan Valley in June 2020. This agreement, announced on October 21, 2024, focused on restoring pre-2020 patrolling protocols in specific areas along the Line of Actual Control, particularly in the Depsang Plains and Demchok region of Ladakh.",

The Plan promotes tourist-oriented waterfront destinations for kayaks and paddlers: Shoreline Park South, Woodland Park, and Vista Park.\n> &#x20;\n> The City was awarded a \\$1.2 million FWC grant in order to design and implement the Plan '23-'24. Upgrades include a relocated floating dock at Woodland Park, and numerous upgrades including a kayak launch at Shoreline Park South.

It provides a detailed roadmap for transforming the federal government and implementing conservative policies in a future Republican presidential administration.\n\n> Key Components\n\n> The initiative is built on four main pillars: a nearly 900-page policy guide called ‚ÄúMandate for Leadership 2025,‚Äù a personnel database to identify conservative candidates for government positions, a ‚ÄúPresidential Administration Academy‚Äù for training future administration officials, and a 180-day action playbook for immediate implementation.\n\n> Policy Areas\n\n> Project 2025 proposes significant changes across nearly all areas of government, including restructuring federal agencies, immigration and border policies, reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ protections, law enforcement, economic regulation, and social programs. The plan emphasizes reducing the size of the federal government, centralizing executive power, and implementing traditional conservative values.\n\nThe spreadsheet on which the Project 2025 Tracker is based can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0).&#x20;",

But what if there‚Äôs a third option for managing superintelligence risks, one that embraces rapid progress while distributing rather than concentrating power?*\n\n***\n\nThe d/acc scenario envisions decentralized arbitration systems handling significant commercial disputes as an alternative to slow, expensive traditional courts. However, the critical barrier is legal enforceability‚Äîwithout traditional court systems recognizing these decisions, they remain limited to digital assets and crypto-native disputes. As of 2021, only one country (Mexico) [had enforced a decentralized blockchain arbitration decision](https://legalblogs.wolterskluwer.com/arbitration-blog/arbitration-tech-toolbox-is-a-mexican-court-decision-the-first-stone-to-bridging-the-blockchain-arbitral-order-with-national-legal-orders/), based on the [Kleros protocol](https://kleros.io/about/). This question measures whether decentralized arbitration is achieving the legal legitimacy necessary to handle mainstream commercial disputes, representing a key test of whether alternative governance systems can gain institutional recognition within existing legal frameworks rather than replacing them entirely.\n\nFor more, visit: [<u>AI Pathways: Two Scenarios for the Future of AI</u>](https://ai-pathways.existentialhope.com/)",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as the number of distinct countries on December 31, 2027 where any national, state, or provincial court according to [<u>credible sources</u>](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) has issued an official judgment, ruling or order that enforces a judgment from either the Kleros or Aragon Court decentralized arbitration platforms.",
        "fine_print": "To further clarify, in order to count the court must issue an official ruling, order, or judgment that relies upon a decision made by a decentralized arbitration platform, rather than making its own separate judgment. An example that would count is a court in Mexico in 2021 [relying](https://legalblogs.wolterskluwer.com/arbitration-blog/arbitration-tech-toolbox-is-a-mexican-court-decision-the-first-stone-to-bridging-the-blockchain-arbitral-order-with-national-legal-orders/) upon a Kleros arbitration decision and enforcing the arbitral award. Due to that event, this question begins with **1** as the lowest bracket.\n\nHybrid arbitration approaches count so long as the substance of the dispute is resolved primarily through the decentralized arbitration platform. For example, the case in Mexico in 2021 [used](https://blog.kleros.io/how-to-enforce-blockchain-dispute-resolution-in-court-the-kleros-case-in-mexico/)\n\n> . . . a sort of hybrid concept of arbitration, according to which it is possible to have \"traditional arbitrators\" conducting the proceedings while using decentralized protocols and technological tools (cyberjuries, artificial intelligence, or any other technology that could be used to facilitate dispute resolution) actually to settle the substantial controversy.",

The 18 state capitals are: Khartoum, Port Sudan (Red Sea), Wad Madani (Gezira), Kassala, Gedaref, Ad-Damazin (Blue Nile), Sennar, Dongola (Northern), Atbara (River Nile), El-Obeid (North Kordofan), Kadugli (South Kordofan), En Nahud (West Kordofan), El-Fasher (North Darfur), Nyala (South Darfur), Zalingei (Central Darfur), El-Geneina (West Darfur), and Ed Daein (East Darfur), plus Damazin (Blue Nile).

A state capital counts as \"under RSF control\" if RSF forces hold administrative buildings and maintain operational control without active SAF presence. A capital counts as \"under dispute\" if fighting is ongoing, control is contested, or if the city is under siege by RSF forces even if not fully captured.

        "description": "*This is a Metaculus Learning Academy question, where you're heavily encouraged to post your rationale in the comments section and get (and give) constructive feedback. The purpose is to improve your forecasting skills.*\n\nAt the time of this question, Zohran Mamdani, as the official candidate of the Democratic Party,  is on a trajectory to win the [blue](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/new-york-city/new-york-city-2024-election-vote-totals/5959798/) city of New York. He leads the [polling averages](https://www.racetothewh.com/nycmayorpolling) with 38.5% of the vote, as compared with 24.6% for former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and 10.9% for Mayor Eric Adams. The fourth major candidate, Republican Curtis Sliwa, is at 14.8% in the polling averages. Ideologically, Mamdani is a progressive leftist, while Cuomo and Adams are positioned more toward the center. Thus Mamdani, although he has significantly under 50% of the vote, has a comfortable lead against a divided field.&#x20;\n\nThis divided field has led to calls, including among the candidates themselves, for someone to drop out. According to [Politico](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook/2025/08/05/cuomo-and-adams-wont-get-out-of-each-others-way-00493471):&#x20;\n\n> You‚Äôd be hard pressed to find a collection of New Yorkers who are more stubborn than Andrew Cuomo, Eric Adams and Curtis Sliwa,‚Äù said Democratic strategist Trip Yang. ‚ÄúThe only shot that the anti-Mamdani forces have of stopping the Democratic nominee in a heavily Democratic city is to consolidate. The chances of that happening are slim to none.‚Äù\n\nMost polls ([example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TggWOuou2l51baFzG48GhTdRacSh0YbQyWu8Vjs0lH4/edit?slide=id.g3718dd780c5_1_87#slide=id.g3718dd780c5_1_87)) find that in the event of one of the non-Mamdani candidates dropping out, most of their support gets distributed to the remaining field rather than to Mamdani, which thus reduces Mamdani's lead.",

        "description": "[Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644 (2015)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges), is a landmark civil rights case in which the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) ruled that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The 5‚Äì4 ruling requires all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and the Insular Areas to perform and recognize the marriages of same-sex couples on the same terms and conditions as the marriages of opposite-sex couples, with all the accompanying rights and responsibilities.\n\nIn the years following the ruling in *Obergefell*, during the Trump administration, several justices departed the Court and were replaced by justices widely considered to be conservative, altering the balance of the Court. [Some observers now consider the Court to be 'aggressively conservative'](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/aggressively-conservative-supreme-court-plunges-into-us-culture-wars-2022-01-25/), and in the midst of a ['conservative revolution'](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-roberts-court-vs-the-trump-court/). \n\n[Some now believe](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/some-fear-ripple-effect-on-civil-rights-cases-if-roe-is-overturned) that the SCOTUS may eventually overturn various precedentially important rulings, including [Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade), [Lawrence v. Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas), and  Obergefell v. Hodges.",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if prior to January 1, 2030, the Supreme Court issues a ruling that results in Obergefell v. Hodges being overturned, in the sense that the Court determines that there is not a constitutionally protected right to marry that is guaranteed to same-sex couples in the United States, and that states, insular areas, the District of Columbia, and/or the federal government may therefore legislate not to permit the practice of same-sex marriage, or to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples",

(Or if the ATP is no longer the official governing body of men's professional tennis, another credible source may be used at the discretion of Metaculus admins.)\n\nAlcaraz will be considered retired if he officially declares his retirement for a period of 3 years or longer, if he does not participate in professional tennis tournaments for 3 years or longer, or by January 1, 2075.",

The specificity and resolvability of these questions may deviate somewhat from typical norms found on Metaculus. For a more thorough description of the aims of these questions, please visit the question series [page](https://www.metaculus.com/project/3508/).*\n\nDeep Learning is a subset of machine learning and artificial intelligence that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence \"deep\") to learn from large amounts of data. The field's [rapid advancement](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/artificial-intelligence-training-computation) has been fueled by a perfect storm of technological progress: exponential growth in computing power, the proliferation of big data, and breakthrough algorithms that have unlocked new possibilities in machine learning.\n\nThe market for deep learning technologies and applications is expected to experience substantial growth in the coming years, reflecting the increasing adoption and expanding use cases across industries. Many analysts predict a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) [well into the double digits](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-deep-learning-market-size-134000643.html) for the deep learning market through the end of the decade. This growth is anticipated to be driven by factors such as the increasing demand for AI-powered analytics in business decision-making, the integration of deep learning in edge devices and IoT, and ongoing advancements in neural network architectures and training methodologies.",

        "description": "Bloomberg maintains its [Real-Time Billionaires list](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/), which is a tracker that is updated every day, ranking the world's wealthiest individuals based on net worth. In recent years, the list [has been topped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires) by Bernard Arnault & family, Jeff Bezos, and Bill Gates. As of December 20, 2024, Elon Musk is in first place on the list, with \\$455 billion, as compared with Jeff Bezos in second place with \\$242 billion, Mark Zuckerberg in third place with \\$211 billion, and Larry Ellison in fourth place with \\$190 billion.\n\nElon Musk's wealth comes first and primarily from his shares of [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/). According to Tesla's [proxy statement for 2024](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000110465924048040/tm2326076d13_pre14a.htm), Musk beneficially owned 20.5% of Tesla's shares. With a [market cap](https://companiesmarketcap.com/tesla/marketcap/) at the time of this question of ¬†1.249 Trillion, his stake in Tesla is worth 256 billion.\n\nSecondly, Elon Musk [reportedly owns](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/musk-net-worth-spacex-trump-b2660290.html) 42% of [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/), which was recently valued at \\$210 billion. This stake is worth \\$88 billion, at that valuation. Additional stakes owned by Musk are 54%of [xAI](https://x.ai/), a startup valued at 50 billion; [Neuralink](https://neuralink.com/), which was valued at \\$5 billion; the [Boring Company](http://www.boringcompany.com/), valued at \\$5.68 billion in 2022, and, X (formerly Twitter), which was [recently valued](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/01/elon-musk-x-fidelity-mark-up) at about \\$12 billion.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

If Musk is not ranked #1, then this question resolves as **No**.",
        "fine_print": "* If both Elon Musk and another individual are ranked #1, this resolves as **No**.\n* If the Billionaires Index is not available on December 31, 2025, this question will be resolved as the first day for which it is available. If it is not available before January 4, 2026, this question will be **annulled**.\n* Bloomberg outlines its methodology [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/methodology/).\n* In the event of Bloomberg changing its methodology for calculating the net worths of the individuals on its list, Admins will make a determination about whether the change is substantial enough to annul the question, at their discretion.",

        "description": "[*C. elegans*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans) is a roundworm that's about 1 millimeter in length. It's often used as a model organism to study neurology due to the extreme simplicity of its nervous system, with only [302 neurons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK116086/) and 56 glial cells. Its nervous system was [first described](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4360118/) in 1986, yet as of June 2025 still unable to be modeled, which is a persistent .&#x20;\n\nThe [OpenWorm](https://openworm.org/) project for example has worked since 2011 as an open-source collaboration to model *C. elegans*, which has been a tough slog. According to Wired:&#x20;\n\n> If OpenWorm can manage this, it would be the first virtual animal‚Äîand an embodiment of all our knowledge not only about *C. elegans*, which is one of the most-studied animals in science, but about how brains interact with the world to produce behavior: the ‚Äúholy grail,‚Äù as OpenWorm puts it, of systems biology.\n\n> Unfortunately, they haven‚Äôt managed it. The simulation on my laptop takes data culled from experiments done with living worms and translates it into a computational framework called c302, which then drives the simulated musculature of a *C. elegans* worm in a fluid dynamic environment‚Äîall in all, a simulation of how a worm squiggles forward in a flat plate of goo. It takes about 10 hours of compute time to generate five seconds of this behavior.\n\nConvergent Research, a non-profit funder of scientific research, has put together a Gap Map of bottlenecks slowing scientific advancement. Big on the Gap Map is [Digital Replicas of the Whole Brain of a Model Organism](https://www.gap-map.org/capabilities/digital-replicas-of-the-whole-brain-of-a-model-organism/). An eventual goal is of course understanding the [human brain](https://www.gap-map.org/fields/neuroscience/), especially to overcome diseases such as Alzheimer's. Cracking the code of C. elegans would therefore be an important first step.&#x20;\n\nSee Also\n\n* MIT News: [Modeling complex behavior with a simple organism](https://news.mit.edu/2025/modeling-complex-behavior-steven-flavell-0121) | By studying the roundworm C. elegans, neuroscientist Steven Flavell explores how neural circuits give rise to behavior.\n* Science Advances: [Nervous system‚Äìwide analysis of all *C. elegans* cadherins reveals neuron-specific functions across multiple anatomical scales](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads2852)\n* Nature Computational Science: [A simulated *C. elegans* with biophysically detailed neurons and muscle dynamics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00740-2)",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as the year in which, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) such as peer-reviewed papers, software based on a neural model of *C. elegans* generates motor commands for a virtual *C. elegan*s body in a closed-loop simulated environment, with greater than or equal to 90% accuracy over what is considered the canonical behaviors of the microorganism at the time.",
        "fine_print": "A closed-loop simulated environment requires that the virtual worm's motor commands change its body, which alters the sensory inputs it then receives (touch, temperature, etc.), which then feeds back into or triggers its next motor commands, and so on. Kinematic replay of previously-recorded behavior does not count.&#x20;\n\nFor a given test to count, no manual overriding of behavior should occur. Any weights or parameters must be set before the test.\n\n90% accuracy means that for each canonical behavior tested, the software must achieve ‚â•90% event-level accuracy when compared to *C. elegan*s wild-type worms, using the accepted quantitative metrics at the time of the test (e.g., propulsion and muscle contraction), possibly according to [Wormbase](https://wormbase.org/) or [The Caenorhabditis Natural Diversity Resource](https://caendr.org/).\n\nThe neural model must contain a representation of every neuron and synaptic connection of the simulated *C. elegan*s. Simplifications of certain neural dynamics may be acceptable if biologically justified, as determined by Metaculus.&#x20;",

        "description": "In March 2023, the French President, Emmanuel Macron, is facing increasing pressure over his controversial [pension reform bill](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/16/emmanuel-macron-uses-special-powers-to-force-pension-reform-france), which he pushed through without a final vote by the [National Assembly, invoking Article 49.3 of the French Constitution](https://www.politico.eu/article/macron-invokes-nuclear-option-to-force-through-his-pensions-reform-in-huge-political-setback/).  This move has sparked [nationwide protests](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-65057249) and led to some of the worst street violence in recent years. The reform aims to raise the minimum retirement age from [62 to 64](https://www.nytimes.com/article/france-pension-strikes-macron-explainer.html) to improve the financial sustainability of the French pension system. Strikes and demonstrations have caused widespread disruption in France, with at least [one million](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/24/1165759889/more-than-1-million-demonstrate-across-france-against-pension-reforms) people participating in protests at one point.\n\nMacron's approval rating has dropped as low as [28%](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20230322-macron-breaks-silence-on-france-s-bitter-pension-battle-the-key-takeaways), as two-thirds of the French population oppose the law. As the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/b78f2a89-1062-4423-a4ba-fb4cdc56c683) points out: \n\n> French anger transcends pensions and Macron‚Äôs high-handedness. There‚Äôs a generalised, long-term rage against the state and its embodiment, the president.\n\nSome of the protestors also [chanted](https://www.commondreams.org/news/macron-resign-french-protests-intensify-over-attempt-to-force-retirement-age-hike) ‚ÄúMacron demission‚Äù (Macron resign), raising the stakes for a continued presidential tenure. Because this is already Macron‚Äôs second term, [he will not be able to stand for re-election](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/04/22/why-is-it-so-unusual-for-a-french-president-to-win-re-election). As such, Macron‚Äôs tenure ends in 2027 after the maximum tenure of five years. However, there are concerns about whether Macron will be able to govern effectively for the remainder of this term and may choose to resign before 2027. As some [commentators](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/02/20/macron-knows-finished-might-just-choose-resign/) have put it, ‚ÄúMacron knows he‚Äôs finished. He might just choose to resign.‚Äù\n\n> The idea is that, like General de Gaulle in 1969, he would prefer to resign grandly rather than endure a ‚Äúcohabitation‚Äù with an opposition prime minister, as Fran√ßois Mitterrand did in 1986-88 with Jacques Chirac, and Chirac himself had to between 1997 and 2002 with the Socialist Lionel Jospin.",

Metaculus will rely on the best available information to determine the final value.\n\nIf Yahoo Finance, or other sources list a new sector not listed on August 23, 2025, Metaculus will judge whether the new sector is a subsection of \"Technology\" or \"Communication Services\" that has been split off. If Metaculus determines that this has occurred, it will additionally consider the new sections in the resolution of this question.",

        "description": "Although democracies are generally unlikely to enter civil war (see this [list of civil wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civil_wars#1945_to_2020) for a rough overview), the United States faces a particularly unusual situation at the moment. The current [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), [social protests](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html), effects of [social media platform manipulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PGm8LslEb4), and the [presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election) all have the potential to disrupt social cohesion and garner negative attitudes toward the government. See this related question for a shorter timeframe: [Will the USA enter a second civil war before July 2021?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4764/will-the-usa-enter-a-second-civil-war-before-july-2021/)",

        "fine_print": "Any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question.  Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.\n\nConflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.\n\nDeaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States.  New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.",

Studies suggest substantial rapid and enduring antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy among patients with [major depressive disorder](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2772630).\n\n The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted psilocybin breakthrough therapy designation.

Metaculus will rely on the best available information and estimates to determine the final value.\n\nThis question will wait until January 1, 2029 to resolve, so that there is sufficient time for high quality estimates to become available.",

Early talks were held in Belarus and Turkey in February 2022, but these negotiations stalled due to disagreements over key issues like territorial control and NATO membership ([<u>New York Times</u>](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/world/europe/ukraine-russia-talks-belarus.html), [<u>Al Jazeera</u>](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/10/top-russia-ukraine-diplomats-arrive-in-turkey-for-talks)). Recently, U.S. President Donald Trump has been involved in efforts to restart negotiations, following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin ([<u>The Guardian</u>](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/trump-putin-ukraine-ceasefire)). In February 2025, negotiations between the U.S. and Ukraine over access to Ukraine‚Äôs critical minerals in exchange for security guarantees fell through after the two countries‚Äô presidents clashed in the Oval Office ([<u>NBC News</u>](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/zelenskyy-trump-white-house-russia-peace-talks-rare-earth-minerals-rcna194118)). The two countries met again in Saudi Arabia on 11 March 2025, and Ukraine agreed to support the U.S.‚Äôs proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia ([<u>Reuters</u>](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-ukraine-meet-saudi-arabia-after-disastrous-white-house-talks-2025-03-11/)).¬† In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he supports the idea of the ceasefire proposal, but that there are still outstanding questions to address ([<u>BBC</u>](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8l00l4rejo)). Russia‚Äôs agreement is still required for the ceasefire to take effect.",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as the period when a bilateral ceasefire or peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine first officially enters into effect, as declared by both governments. The question resolves based on when the agreement is officially implemented, regardless of whether individual violations occur afterward. An agreement is bilateral if it applies to both Russian and Ukrainian official military forces.\n\nThe question will be resolved using the day the ceasefire first goes into effect. There is no requirement that the ceasefire actually lasts for its intended duration.\n\nThe ceasefire must formally prohibit offensive combat operations (including artillery/missile strikes, ground assaults, aerial bombardment, and naval attacks) across all official and disputed Ukrainian and Russian territory. Continued non-combat military activities (such as resupply, fortification, aerial patrols, or casualty recovery) will not affect resolution. A limited ceasefire (such as granting safety to humanitarian corridors or specific regions) is insufficient to resolve the question.",
        "fine_print": "* Reaching a ceasefire agreement is not sufficient on its own. This question asks about the date it takes effect and the duration.\n* The date the ceasefire goes into effect will be determined using credible international reporting sources.\n* The question will resolve as ‚Äú**Not before 2026‚Äù** if a bilateral ceasefire does not enter into effect before 00:00 January 1, 2026 Ukraine Time (UTC+2).\n* A qualifying ceasefire must be formally negotiated and mutually agreed upon by both governments under the same terms. Two separate unilateral declarations, even if they occur simultaneously or mirror each other‚Äôs actions, do not constitute a bilateral ceasefire for the purpose of this question.",

        "description": "The [Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act), passed in August 2022, represents the most significant U.S. climate legislation in history, allocating \\$369 billion in clean energy investments. The law includes:\n\n* Tax credits for electric vehicles, solar panels, and wind power.\n* Incentives for domestic clean energy manufacturing (e.g., EV batteries, hydrogen).\n* Funding for emissions reductions and energy efficiency programs.\n* Methane fee regulations on oil and gas producers.\n* Support for nuclear energy and carbon capture technology.\n\nSince its passage, the IRA has faced political challenges:\n\n* **Republican opposition:** Many [GOP lawmakers](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-will-happen-to-the-inflation-reduction-act-under-a-republican-trifecta/), particularly in the House, have called for repealing or scaling back the IRA‚Äôs climate spending, arguing it distorts markets and increases federal spending.\n* **Trump‚Äôs campaign pledge:** Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly [vowed](https://time.com/7262600/how-trump-is-trying-to-undo-the-inflation-reduction-act/) to roll back the IRA‚Äôs climate provisions, calling them a ‚Äúdisaster for American energy independence.‚Äù\n* **Industry response:** The clean energy sector has benefited from IRA subsidies, but fossil fuel advocates and some [manufacturing](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/inflation-reduction-act-sparked-a-manufacturing-clean-energy-boom.html) groups have pushed for modifications, particularly on labor requirements tied to tax credits.",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2026, a federal bill that explicitly amends, repeals, or significantly modifies the climate-related provisions of the [Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)](https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/summary-inflation-reduction-act-provisions-related-renewable-energy) becomes law, by presidential signature or congressional override of a veto.\n\nFor this question to resolve as **Yes**, the bill must either restrict the eligibility criteria for IRA climate benefits (e.g., who qualifies for EV tax credits) or reduce the available funds for any climate program by any amount. This could happen in various ways, including but not limited to rescinding unspent funds, shifting budget allocations (even among different climate programs), and repealing or cutting clean energy tax credits, clean energy incentives, or environmental investments.",
        "fine_print": "The question will *not* resolve as **Yes** if:\n\n* The executive branch changes IRA implementation through rulemaking without congressional action.\n* Changes are made exclusively through appropriations riders (e.g., defunding programs in the budget process) without statutory amendments.\n* Partial modifications are passed that do not result in a reduction in climate funding or a restriction in climate benefits, such as adjusting implementation timelines or minor technical amendments.\n\nIf there is ambiguity about whether a bill qualifies, reports by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), official legislative summaries, and expert analysis from sources such as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) might be used by Metaculus to resolve this question.",

But what if there‚Äôs a third option for managing superintelligence risks, one that embraces rapid progress while distributing rather than concentrating power?*\n\n***\n\nThe d/acc scenario identifies insurance industry actions as a key forcing function in steering deployment away from opaque, agentic AI systems toward more transparent, human-controllable alternatives. This question tests a central prediction: that liability concerns will make AI systems without meaningful human oversight effectively uninsurable in high-stakes domains. Such exclusions, particularly by large insurers, could serve as an early constraint on agentic AI adoption, reshaping technology adoption patterns before regulation does. Like court rulings and licensing standards, insurance exclusions offer a mechanism through which economic incentives reinforce governance-aligned AI architectures.\n\nFor more, visit: [AI Pathways: Two Scenarios for the Future of AI](https://ai-pathways.existentialhope.com/)",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions), before January 1, 2028 any of the following U.S. insurers introduces a broad, absolute policy exclusion for damages arising from AI systems that operate without human override capabilities:\n\nTop-5 US Property & Casualty Insurers:\n\n* State Farm\n* Progressive\n* Allstate\n* Liberty Mutual\n* USAA\n\nTop-5 US Health Insurers:\n\n* UnitedHealth Group\n* Elevance Health Inc. (formerly Anthem)\n* Centene Corporation\n* Humana\n* CVS Health (Aetna)",
        "fine_print": "An example of an absolute exclusion that would count for purposes of this question is the one introduced in 2025 by Berkley Insurance Co. ([Law 360](https://www.hunton.com/insights/publications/how-insurance-policies-are-adapting-to-ai-risk), [National Law Review](https://natlawreview.com/article/continued-proliferation-ai-exclusions))\n\nA broad, absolute exclusion of AI means the insurance company explicitly excludes or denies coverage for damages arising from AI systems that lack human override capabilities (i.e, the ability for humans to intervene in or alter AI system decisions before implementation), or does so via a blanket AI exclusion that clearly applies to such systems as a subset of a wider group. Thus, sector-specific exclusions (e.g., a hypothetical scenario in which USAA announces it will explicitly exclude coverage vehicles operating autonomously but remains silent on its other insurance lines) do not qualify unless they establish a general principle applicable across the company's entire portfolio of policy types.\n\nThis question asks whether insurers broadly exclude coverage in their standard policies for AI systems lacking human override capabilities. Thus, if the insurance company sells [riders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rider.asp) or add-ons to allow coverage of AI lacking human oversight, it will still count for purposes of this question.&#x20;",

In 2025, the prospect of automation displacing work was often framed as a threat. By 2035, in much of the world, it is seen as a trade worth making. The combination of reduced hours, safer work, better health, and more time for human pursuits has made life better for most, though not all.*\n\n***\n\nThis question evaluates whether governments begin testing large-scale basic income programs in response to AI-driven economic change. In the Tool AI scenario, rising productivity enables predistribution models, with AI helping simulate and manage UBI systems. A government-funded UBI pilot covering tens of thousands of people would support the scenario‚Äôs claims about economic adaptation.\n\nFor more, visit:[ <u>https://ai-pathways.existentialhope.com</u>](https://ai-pathways.existentialhope.com)",

Geographic or age-based targeting is permitted.\n* Sufficient Scale: At least 25,000 individuals are receiving payments simultaneously.\n* Publicly Funded: The program is primarily funded by a national government.

In 2025, the prospect of automation displacing work was often framed as a threat. By 2035, in much of the world, it is seen as a trade worth making. The combination of reduced hours, safer work, better health, and more time for human pursuits has made life better for most, though not all.*\n\n***\n\nThis question tests whether geopolitical actors will formalize guardrails on AGI development. In the Tool AI scenario, international tensions push some countries to double down on speed, while others prioritize safety, transparency, and coordination. A treaty specifically addressing AGI development‚Äîespecially with verification‚Äîwould represent a major institutional step toward the scenario‚Äôs preferred path of non-agentic AI.\n\nFor more, visit:[ <u>https://ai-pathways.existentialhope.com</u>](https://ai-pathways.existentialhope.com)",

An official treaty or accord is signed by authorized representatives of both the United States and Chinese governments.\n2. The agreement explicitly includes legally-binding provisions to limit the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).&#x20;\n3. The agreement establishes verification mechanisms, such as mutual inspections, data sharing, or third-party monitoring.",
        "fine_print": "Non-binding declarations or joint statements will not be considered sufficient for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe agreement must specifically address AGI. Agreements focused on narrow AI or general technology controls without AGI-specific limitations will result in a \"No\" resolution.\n\nIf either government publicly repudiates the agreement before the end of 2030, the question will be resolved as \"No.\"\n\nTreaties that require legislative ratification will be resolved based on the date of the executive signing.\n\nThis question generally does not define AGI and relies on the definition posed by the treaty or accord. However, if there is terminology (e.g., \"ultra-advanced AI\") which is defined by the agreement as meaning a system capable of performing human-level cognitive tasks across a wide range of domains without specific programming for those tasks, or an equivalent definition, then that terminology will count as synonymous with AGI for the purposes of this question.\n\nThe treaty or accord need not be bilateral. A multilateral treaty or accord counts as well.\n\nAs stated in the Resolution Criteria, any agreement must explicitly cover AGI as described in these criteria. A treaty or accord about AI concepts such as \"dangerous AI\" or \"advanced AI\" will not count if it does not explicitly cover AGI as described here.",

        "description": "Following the 2024 EU Parliament elections, France saw the rise of the right wing National Rally. This made French president Emmanuel Macron call early legislative elections and dissolution of the National Assembly, in response. \n\nFollowing the 2024 french legislative elections, the National Assembly has been mostly split three-ways, between the big tent, left wing grouping [New Popular Front with 180 seats; the centrist Ensemble with 159 seats; and the aforementioned National rally with 142 seats. None of the above gaining a majority in the 577 seat parliament](https://www.resultats-elections.interieur.gouv.fr/legislatives2024/ensemble_geographique/index.html). Some feel that this polarized parliament could lead to government deadlock, with any formed government potentially having a hard time surviving a motion of no confidence against it. This may potentially lead to Macron calling another snap election before the next scheduled legislative election, to ease the potential deadlock, which the french constitution only allow after a year since the previous legislative election.\n\nSee also from Le Monde: [Snap elections in France: How it works, precedents, and consequences](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/les-decodeurs/article/2024/06/10/snap-elections-in-france-how-it-works-precedents-and-consequences_6674391_8.html)",

        "description": "There has been [speculation](https://archive.ph/jZduA) that the assumed successor of North Korea leader Kim Jong Un might be his \\~12 year-old daughter, Kim Ju-ae. They have appeared in several public ceremonies, [such as](https://apnews.com/article/politics-north-korea-government-kim-jong-un-united-states-d5bb73116705610eca6cec2210dd4303) at a North Korean military parade in 2023. There is a [likely](https://www.nknews.org/pro/north-korea-upgrading-military-parade-training-base-ahead-of-likely-oct-event/) military parade being held in October 2025.&#x20;\n\nAccording to Chapter 2 of The Dictator's Handbook:&#x20;\n\n> Health concerns for North Korea‚Äôs Kim Jong Il and Cuba‚Äôs Fidel Castro have engendered similarly intense political speculation. Both have attempted to stave off defection by their essential coalition members by nominating heirs. Kim Jong Il promoted his youngest son, Kim Jong Un, to a variety of posts, including the rank of four-star general, even though his son has no military experience. Fidel Castro likewise promoted his brother, Raul, to president when Fidel‚Äôs survival was in doubt following major surgery. By designating heirs who might keep the existing winning coalition largely intact, these leaders sought to prevent the incumbency advantage from disappearing as their ability to deliver on political promises was brought into jeopardy.\n\n> Impending death often induces political death. The sad truth is that if you want to come to power in an autocracy you are better off stealing medicalrecords than you are devising fixes for your nation‚Äôs ills.\n\nChapter 1:&#x20;\n\n> *Rule 1: Keep your winning coalition as small as possible.* A small coalition allows a leader to rely on very few people to stay in power. Fewer essentials equals more control and contributes to more discretion over expenditures.\n\n> Bravo for Kim Jong Il of North Korea \\[father of Kim Jong Un]. He is a contemporary master at ensuring dependence on a small coalition.\n\nThe Kim family has dominated the North Korean leadership since 1948, with the rulers being Kim Il Sung, who led the country from 1948 until 1994; Kim Jong Il, who led from 1994 to 2011; and present leader, Kim Jong Un, who has led North Korea since 2011, technically under the title of [General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Workers%27_Party_of_Korea).&#x20;",

In 2025, the prospect of automation displacing work was often framed as a threat. By 2035, in much of the world, it is seen as a trade worth making.

These tariffs, described as unprecedented in scale, are projected to increase inflation while slowing growth, potentially leading to stagflation‚Äîa scenario where high inflation coincides with economic stagnation. [<u>The World Trade Organization forecasts global GDP growth at 2.2% in 2025, 0.6% lower than without tariffs</u>](https://www.wto.org/english/blogs_e/ce_ralph_ossa_e/blog_ro_16apr25_e.htm), underscoring their impact.

The next Fed Chair will need to navigate these tensions, balancing domestic political pressures with the Fed‚Äôs traditional independence, which markets value for stability. Trump‚Äôs past nominations, like Judy Shelton, and considerations of figures like Kevin Warsh or Kevin Hassett, suggest he may prioritize loyalty or unconventional economic views, potentially reshaping Fed policy.\n\nThis question is crucial as the nominee‚Äôs identity will signal Trump‚Äôs economic priorities, influence market confidence, and affect global financial stability.

        "description": "Jerome Powell, [Chair of the Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) of the Federal Reserve System also known as the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), was nominated by President Donald Trump in November 2017, and his nomination was confirmed by the US Senate the following January in a bipartisan 84-13 vote. In November 2021, Powell was re-nominated by President Joe Biden for second term, which passed the Senate 80-19. In addititon to his role as FRB Chair, Powell is also Chairman of the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fomc.asp) (FOMC), which determines the [fed funds rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp) (which impacts interest rates), and began serving both roles in February 2018. Powell's current terms for each role expires on May 15, 2026.&#x20;\n\nIn January 2025, Trump was inaugurated for a second term. On April 2, 2025, he [announced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_Day_tariffs) a massive expansion in America's tariffs on other countries, [described](https://www.cato.org/blog/trumps-tariffs-arent-reciprocal-are-massive-tax-increase-americans) by the Cato Institute as \"possibly even exceeding the notorious Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, which contributed to the Great Depression.\"&#x20;\n\nIn a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell said the tariffs were \"significantly larger than anticipated,\" adding that the economic effects \"will include higher inflation and slower growth\" and that therefore the Federal Reserve would remain patient and see how everything played out before making any big adjustments to interest rates.\n\nThe first major sign of Trump's dissatisfaction with Chair Powell came the next day, on April 17, when Trump [posted](https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1912827529133539730) (emphasis added):&#x20;\n\n> The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, ‚ÄúToo Late‚Äù Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete ‚Äúmess!‚Äù Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late **should have lowered Interest Rates**, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. **Powell‚Äôs termination cannot come fast enough!**\n\nA few days later, Trump [called](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114376239725335883) Powell a \"major loser,\" reiterating his demand that interest rates be lowered. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett [said](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-trump-fire-powell-term-end-federal-reserve-what-to-know/) the Trump Administration was studying whether Powell could be fired. Trump additionally said, \"If I want him out, he‚Äôll be out of there real fast, believe me. I‚Äôm not happy with him.\"&#x20;\n\nHowever, [according to CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/17/economy/trump-fed-chair-powell-termination/index.html):\n\n> For his part, Powell has pointedly noted that removing a Fed chair is ‚Äúnot permitted under the law,‚Äù and has said he intends to serve out the remainder of his term.\n\n> However, that legal protection, which comes as a result of the Fed‚Äôs status as an independent government institution, may be an open question. Trump has fired two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, also a long-independent agency, arguing that their ‚Äúcontinued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my administration‚Äôs priorities,‚Äù according to a Wall Street Journal report of a letter Trump sent to them.\n\n> On Wednesday, Trump fired two Democrats on the three-member board of the National Credit Union Administration, a federal insurer and regulator of credit unions. Todd Harper, one of the officials dismissed by Trump, said in a post on LinkedIn that his firing ‚Äúis wrong.‚Äù\n\nThen on April 22, Trump [denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/trump-powell-fed.html) having any plans to fire Powell, with signs, for the moment, of deescalation.&#x20;\n\nNo US president [has ever attempted](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/could-trump-fire-powell-1.7515197) to fire a Fed chair, and legally members of the Board of Governors can only be removed for \"cause,\" which has long been interpreted as misconduct.&#x20;\n\nSee also:\n\n* Brookings Institution (2019): [What happens if Trump tries to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-happens-if-trump-tries-to-fire-fed-chair-jerome-powell/)&#x20;\n* American Enterprise Institute: [There‚Äôs Only One Way Trump Can Fix Powell‚Äôs Opposition at the Fed](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/theres-only-one-way-trump-can-fix-powells-opposition-at-the-fed/)\n* Axios: [Can Trump fire Fed chair Jerome Powell? Here's what to know.](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/17/trump-fire-jerome-powell-fed-humphreys-executor)",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump or the US government publicly states before May 1, 2026 that Jerome Powell is terminated, dismissed, or forcibly replaced (resignations or voluntary departures do not count) before his scheduled term end date of May 15, 2026, from either his role as Chair of the [Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed.htm) (FRB) or his role as Chair of the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) (FOMC).",
        "fine_print": "This question resolves upon the qualifying announcement or public statement from Trump or the US government. Whether Powell actually leaves his role as FOMC Chair or FRB Chair before his current term expires is immaterial to this question's resolution. Therefore, potential interventions such as a court enjoining the termination will not prevent the question from resolving as **Yes**.\n\nStatements by Trump need not explicitly mention Powell being terminated. For example, naming Powell's immediate successor or thanking Powell for his service, as for example occurred with [Secretary of State Rex Tillerson](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump/status/973540316656623616) or [VA Secretary David Shulkin](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/979108653377703936), would count, so long as it is clear the successor has been named as a result of a forcible replacement, and not as a result of Powell's voluntary resignation or departure. For the purposes of this question any resignation by Powell will be considered voluntary, including in cases where media reports suggest or confirm that he was pressured to resign.\n\nIf necessary, Metaculus will consult [credible](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) news media reports to assess the truth of the matter, and Metaculus may wait up to 30 days following the announcement of Powell's departure to determine if the departure was forcible or voluntary. If after 30 days Metaculus assesses that the available evidence is not conclusive, the question will resolve as **ambiguous**.\n\nAs stated in the Resolution Criteria, the relevant statement must be made publicly. Journalistic sources that are one or more steps removed from a non-public statement, such as reporting on private conversations or statements that occurred behind closed doors, will not count.\n\nIf Powell is removed as Chair of the FRB or the FOMC but remains on the Board of Governors, this question still resolves as **Yes**.",

        "description": "SpaceX's Starship system is designed for full, rapid reusability with the ultimate goal of enabling high-frequency launches for missions to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Achieving a high launch cadence is fundamental to this architecture and SpaceX's long-term plans, including deploying its next-generation Starlink satellites and fulfilling its Human Landing System (HLS) contract for NASA's Artemis program.\n\nIn November 2024, Starbase General Manager Kathy Lueders [announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop\\&v=zt8WrIAa2Ok \"announced\") a goal of 25 launches in 2025. Since then, the first two flights [have seen the rockets exploding before reaching 160km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Starship_launches#2025 \"have seen the rockets exploding before reaching an altitude of 160km\") of altitude, delaying the company's goals for the next launches.",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve to the number of times, from January 1 to December 31, 2025 inclusive, that a **Starship launch vehicle reaches an altitude of at least 160 kilometers** during flight.\n\nFor an event to count toward the total, all of the following must be true:\n\n* The flight must involve a **fully stacked Starship** (i.e. both the Super Heavy booster and the upper-stage Starship) at some point between take-off and the end of the flight.\n* The vehicle must reach **at least 160 kilometers** in altitude, according to official SpaceX data (e.g., livestream telemetry), or reporting from credible spaceflight sources.\n* The **upper stage (Starship)** must remain **largely intact** at the time it passes through 160 km (i.e. it must not have exploded or disintegrated before or during ascent).\n\nIf the achieved altitude is close to 160 km but not confirmed, Metaculus admins may wait for post-flight data or commentary from credible sources to resolve. If by January 31, 2026, there is insufficient evidence to determine the number of such launches, the question will be **annulled**.",
        "fine_print": "* Minor fragmentation, damage, or leaks are acceptable as long as the vehicle is still visibly in one piece or described as such by SpaceX or independent aerospace sources.\n* For vehicles that appear to have reached \\~160 km but no official telemetry is released, credible statements such as ‚Äúapproximately 160 kilometers‚Äù or ‚Äúabout 99 miles‚Äù will suffice for inclusion, if they come from SpaceX or credible sources.",

        "description": "The federal budget process in the United States begins with the passage of a [<u>budget resolution</u>](https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation#how-does-congress-start-the-cbpp-anchor) ‚Äî a concurrent resolution passed by both the House and Senate that sets broad fiscal targets for spending, revenue, the deficit, and debt levels. While it provides a framework for the upcoming fiscal year, it does not become law and does not require the president's signature. Importantly, the budget resolution may include reconciliation instructions, which direct specific congressional committees to draft legislation that meets the resolution's fiscal goals. These instructions are optional but allow for the creation of a [<u>reconciliation bill</u>](https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation), which allows the Senate to pass certain budget-related laws with a simple majority vote and limited debate, bypassing the [<u>filibuster</u>](https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/filibusters-cloture.htm).\n\nIf reconciliation instructions are included, the resulting reconciliation bill must be passed by both chambers and signed by the president to become law. It can include changes to spending, revenue, or the debt limit, but is restricted by rules such as the [<u>Byrd Rule</u>](https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation#what-is-the-byrd-rule-cbpp-anchor), which prohibits provisions unrelated to budget changes. If the budget resolution does not include reconciliation instructions, Congress must enact any fiscal changes through the regular legislative process. In this case, changes to [<u>discretionary spending</u>](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/#the-difference-between-mandatory-discretionary-and-supplemental-spending) are made through the annual appropriations bills, which fund specific government departments and require presidential approval. Changes to mandatory spending programs (like Medicare, [<u>Medicaid</u>](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-much-of-the-federal-budget-is-mandatory-spending/), or Social Security), however, require standalone legislation that amends the law governing those programs. These also must pass both chambers and be signed by the president, and they generally face a higher procedural hurdle in the Senate due to the possibility of a filibuster.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included approximately [<u>\\$870 billion in climate and clean energy provisions</u>](https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/evaluating-the-iras-clean-energy-tax-provisions/), with a significant portion allocated to tax credits for renewable energy production, electric vehicles, energy-efficient home improvements, and clean manufacturing.\n\nDuring his 2024 campaign, President Trump pledged to [<u>roll back many of these provisions</u>](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/05/trump-inflation-reduction-act-00177493), criticizing them as wasteful spending that benefited foreign manufacturers and wealthy consumers.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the [<u>House Ways and Means Committee marked up</u>](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Section-by-Section.pdf) its proposed section of the reconciliation bill and included many cuts to IRA tax credits. The [<u>Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the cuts amount to \\$559 billion</u>](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/permanent-ways-means-bill-could-add-53-trillion-deficits) over ten years.",

If no such reconciliation bill is enacted before the end of fiscal year 2025 (before October 1, 2025), this question will be **annulled**.\n\nThe question will resolve according to official scoring of the enacted reconciliation bill (See the [<u>CBO‚Äôs original score of the Inflation Reduction Act</u>](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2022-08/hr5376_IR_Act_8-3-22.pdf) for example).",
        "fine_print": "* This question is asking for the total budgetary impact over the standard 10-year budget window (most likely fiscal years 2026 through 2035, but deferring to the window the CBO or JCT chooses) of provisions that eliminate, reduce, or restrict tax credits related to clean energy, electric vehicles, energy efficiency, and other environmental incentives established by the Inflation Reduction Act.\n* The resolution will be based on the official score from either the Congressional Budget Office or Joint Committee on Taxation, whichever provides the most comprehensive estimate of the relevant provisions.\n* If multiple provisions affect these credits, their impacts will be summed to determine the total reduction. If necessary, credible sources‚Äô summation of raw numbers from the CBO or JCT will be used.\n* For resolution purposes, \"reduce spending\" means the estimated decrease in outlays or tax expenditures relative to the baseline that would have occurred without the 2025 reconciliation bill. Both increased revenue due to credit rollbacks and reductions to refundable credits that count as spending will count for this purpose.\n* Metaculus may use reports from [<u>credible sources</u>](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) if the official score is not available within three months after the passage of the bill, or if the official score does not clearly separate the impact on IRA energy and environmental tax credits from other provisions.",

The project will increase the facility's capacity from 2.0 to 3.5 million gallons per day‚Äîallowing more households to move off septic systems and connect to city sewer.\n\nConstruction began in August 2024, and as of mid-2025, the work was about 25% complete.

It requires the President to disclose a formal intent to impound funds, at which point Congress has a brief period to vote to condone the impoundment. If the vote fails (or Congress doesn't vote), the Act requires the President to make the funding available.\n\n\n\nRecently, President Trump issued an executive order to [<u>pause up to \\$3 trillion in federal grants and loans</u>](https://time.com/7210782/trump-freezes-federal-aid-impoundment/), aiming to review and potentially eliminate certain initiatives.

Jean Carroll, awarding her \\$5 million in damages</u>](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/carroll-trump-jury-deliberations/index.html).

The court rejected Trump's arguments that the trial was unfair due to the admission of evidence about his past conduct, including the \"Access Hollywood\" video. The verdict stemmed from a [<u>1996 incident in which Carroll alleged that Trump assaulted her in a Manhattan department store</u>](https://www.reuters.com/legal/trump-loses-appeal-e-jean-carroll-5-million-defamation-verdict-2024-12-30/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).\n\nDespite the legal setbacks, Trump has continued to deny the allegations, [<u>referring to the case as a \"hoax\" and criticizing the judicial process</u>](https://www.reuters.com/legal/trump-loses-appeal-e-jean-carroll-5-million-defamation-verdict-2024-12-30/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Instead, he has taken several actions to challenge and delay the payments:\n\n* Trump has posted [<u>bonds for both judgments</u>](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/06/trump-now-owes-e-jean-carroll-over-90-million-with-interest-as-appeals-court-hears-first-case/), which means he has paid money into a court-controlled account rather than directly to Carroll.\n* He posted a [<u>\\$5.5 million bond for the first \\$5 million judgment and a \\$91.6 million bond for the second \\$83.3 million judgment</u>](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/06/trump-now-owes-e-jean-carroll-over-90-million-with-interest-as-appeals-court-hears-first-case/).\n\nTrump has filed [<u>appeals against both verdicts</u>](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/30/appeals-court-upholds-trump-sexual-abuse-defamation-liability-verdict). The appeals process is ongoing, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit hearing arguments.",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before January 20, 2029, Donald Trump has paid the full amount of the settlement awarded to E. Jean Carroll by a court judgment. Payment will be considered made if credible sources confirm that Trump has either directly paid Carroll or that the funds have been collected through legal means, such as asset seizures or garnishments.\n\nThe question will resolve as **No** if Trump has not fully paid the settlement, before January 20, 2029. This includes scenarios where he has made partial payments but still owes a remaining balance, if the judgment is overturned or vacated on appeal, or if the settlement is otherwise rendered legally unenforceable.",

However, Tesla reported its [first decline in annual vehicle deliveries](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html) in 2024 and then in the first two quarters of 2025 has had a year-over-year decline.&#x20;\n\nDespite the recent decline, the United States's \\$7,500 EV tax credit expires October 1, 2025, leading some analysts to [speculate](https://www.teslarati.com/why-tesla-q3-could-be-one-its-biggest-quarters-history/) that Q3 2025 could be the biggest quarter in Tesla's history.\n\nTesla [typically reports](https://ir.tesla.com/press) quarterly deliveries ahead of its full earnings, usually on the second day of the following quarter.

Note, however, that not all would have counted for purposes of this question.\n\nChapter 3 of *The Dictator's Handbook* says:&#x20;\n\n> In fact, having competent ministers, or competent corporate board members, can be a dangerous mistake. Competent people, after all, are potential (and potentially competent) rivals.\n\n> The three most important characteristics of a coalition are: (1) Loyalty; (2) Loyalty; (3) Loyalty. Successful leaders surround themselves with trusted friends and family, and rid themselves of any ambitious supporters. Carly Fiorina had a hard time achieving that objective and as a result she failed to last long. Fidel Castro, by contrast, was a master (of course, he had fewer impediments to overcome in what he could do than did Fiorina) and he lasted in power for nearly half a century.\n\n> The implications of this aspect of political logic are profound, particularly in small coalition governments. Saddam Hussein in Iraq, like Idi Amin in Uganda and so many other eventual national leaders, started as a street thug. Autocrats don‚Äôt need West Point graduates to protect them. Once in power, people like Amin and Hussein wisely surround themselves with trusted members of their own tribe or clan, installing them in the most important positions‚Äîthose involving force and money‚Äîand killing anyone that may turn out to be a rival.\n\nAnd then from Chapter 8:\n\n> A prudent dictator nips rebellion in the bud. That is why we have reiterated the claim that only people willing to engage in really nasty behavior should contemplate becoming dictators. The softhearted will find themselves ousted in the blink of an eye",

During their first half year they are nearly twice as likely to be deposed as their democratic counterparts. However, if they survive those first turbulent months, then they have a much better chance of staying in power than democrats. Those early months are difficult because they have not yet worked out where the money is, making them unreliable sources of wealth for their coalition, and they have yet to work out whose support they really need and who they can dump from their transitional coalition.\n\nRisk of ouster by type of government:\n\n<img height=\"394\" width=\"530\" src=\"https://metaculus-web-media.s3.amazonaws.com/user_uploaded/Screenshot_2025-08-20_at_9.57.12AM.png\" />\n\n> Staying in power right after having come to power is tough, but a successful leader will seize power, then reshuffle the coalition that brought him there to redouble his strength. A smart leader sacks some early backers, replacing them with more reliable and cheaper supporters.

He was replaced by his prime minister, Paul Biya, who continues in office as of this writing (2002). Ahidjo first won office in 1960 with a small majority in a closely contested election. However, using opposition violence as a justification, Ahidjo suspended the constitution in 1962, dispensed with competitive elections, and presided over a one-party state, ruling through presidential emergency powers. He stood for re-election several times, but without any opportunity for meaningful electoral opposition. Paul Biya, himself inclined toward dictatorship, later indicted and tried Ahidjo in absentia for allegedly plotting a coup d‚Äôetat for which Ahidjo was sentenced to death. Ahidjo, exiled in France, died peacefully. Biya continues to rule over Cameroon, having been ‚Äúre-elected‚Äù several times by nearly 100 percent of the vote.

President Magufuli had pushed Tanzania deeper into authoritarianism, according to his [obituary](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/world/africa/tanzania-president-magufuli-dead.html) in the New York Times. Suluhu, at that time vice president of Tanzania, [announced](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/africa/tanzania-samia-suluhu-hassan-president-intl/) the death of President Magufuli of heart disease, although his death was marked by rumors of other causes of death, such as it being from complications of COVID-19 or even [poisoning](https://mythdetector.com/en/what-caused-the-death-of-the-tanzanian-president/).\n\nIn the 2021 election, Magufuli, with Suluhu as his running mate, [won](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tanzanian_general_election) with 84.4% of the vote. In the 2015 election, he won with 58.46% of the vote. Previous elections in Tanzania have had the winner receive 62.83%, in 2010, and 80.28% in 2005.&#x20;\n\nIn the upcoming October 2025 election, the main opposition party, CHADEMA, has been [barred](https://www.ictj.org/latest-news/tanzania%E2%80%99s-main-opposition-chadema-party-barred-upcoming-elections) from the election due to failing to sign a mandatory code of conduct form.  According to *The Dictator's Handbook* in Chapter 10:&#x20;\n\n> True, meaningful elections might be the final goal, but elections *for their own sake* should never be the objective. When the international community pushes for elections without being careful about how meaningful they are, all that is accomplished is to further entrench a nasty regime. International inspectors, for instance, like to certify whether people could freely go to the polling place and whether their votes were properly counted, as if that means there was a free and fair election. There‚Äôs no reason to impede the opportunity to vote or to cheat when counting votes if, for instance, a regime first bans parties that might be real rivals, or if a government sets up campaign constraints that make it easy for the government‚Äôs party to tell its story and makes it impossible for the opposition to do the same.",

The purpose is not really to learn about UFOs (although feel free to do that too!), but instead to learn to watch the pace of event occurrences and their trajectory and gain an intuition about doing that type of forecast.* &#x20;\n\nNewsNation: [Over 2K UFO sightings reported in first half of 2025](https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/2000-ufo-sightings-first-half-2025/)\n\n> There have been [more than 2,000 sightings of UFOs](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) in the first half of 2025, according to data from the National UFO Reporting Center, or NUFORC.\n\n> The nonprofit organization collects reports of UFOs and investigates cases of unexplained sightings. The 2,174 sightings are an increase from previous years. In 2024, the agency logged 1,492 sightings between the beginning of January and the end of June, and in 2023, 2,077 were recorded in the same time frame.\n\n...\n\n> Those numbers likely only represent a small number of actual sightings, said Christian Stepien, the group‚Äôs chief technology officer. Based on anecdotal evidence, he believes roughly 5% of sightings get reported.\n\n> The group takes reports from everyday citizens as well as air traffic controllers, police and members of the military.\n\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/):\n\n> The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center‚Äôs primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.",

        "description": "Machine intelligence has been steadily progressing since the invention of the digital computer, but this progress has arguably been accelerating of late, with widespread deployment of machine learning systems and dramatically increased funding of artificial intelligence research.\n\nMachine intelligence long surpassed human capability in numerical computation, application of algorithms, data processing, and games such as checkers and chess.  In 2005-2015 dramatic improvements in [image recognition and classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/tutorials/image_recognition/index.html), [speech transcription](http://qz.com/812317/microsoft-msft-claims-its-speech-transcription-ai-is-now-better-than-human-professionals/), game playing (e.g. [Go](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/) and [classic Atari](https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/)), and [automatic translation across many languages](translate.google.com) have approached or surpassed human levels.  As of 2015 there is still a large gulf, however, in many intellectual capabilities.  *But for how long?*",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as **YES** if the machine system outscores at least two of the three humans on the following test prior to 2040, or **NO** otherwise. If no such tests are conducted, resolves as **AMBIGUOUS**.\n\nAssume that prior to 2040, a generalized intelligence test will be administered as follows.  A team of three expert interviewers will interact with a candidate machine system (MS) and three humans (3H).  The humans will be graduate students in each of physics, mathematics and computer science from one of the top 25 research universities (per some recognized list), chosen independently of the interviewers.  The interviewers will electronically communicate (via text, image, spoken word, or other means) an identical series of exam questions of their choosing over a period of two hours to the MS and 3H, *designed to advantage the 3H.*  Both MS and 3H have full access to the internet, but no party is allowed to consult additional humans or AIs.  The exam will be scored blindly by a disinterested third party.\n\nNote that this also effectively tests whether the internet as a whole functions as a human-level intelligence, in that a positive resolution indicates that the human participants are effectively superfluous.",
