- Baseline: Homo sapiens has existed ~300,000 years; natural existential risks this century are “very unlikely,” total <1 in 10,000 per Ord’s estimates (asteroids, supervolcanoes, supernovae) [Ord 2020].
- Asteroids: ~95% of near‑Earth asteroids >1 km (civilization‑ending scale) are discovered; none pose a significant impact risk in the next 100 years [NASA PDCO 2024; JPL Sentry 2024]. Planetary defense (DART) successfully deflected an asteroid in 2022 [NASA/JHU‑APL 2022–2023].
- Supervolcanoes: Statistically, VEI‑8 “super‑eruptions” recur ~1 per 17,000 years; 75‑year risk ≈0.4% (wide uncertainty) [Rougier et al., ESPL 2018]. No evidence this would cause human extinction.
- Nuclear war: ~12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide; arsenals modernizing [SIPRI Yearbook 2024]. Severe nuclear war could cause multi‑year global food shocks; worst‑case modeling finds billions of deaths but not extinction [Xia et al., Nature Food 2022].
- Pandemics: Deadliest recorded natural pandemics: 1918 influenza ~50 million deaths; COVID‑19 ~18–27 million excess deaths by 2023 (estimates vary) [Johnson & Mueller 2002; WHO/IHME 2023]. No historical pathogen approached species‑level extinction.
- Climate: AR6 projects severe risks (health, food, conflict) under higher warming, but does not assess human extinction as a plausible 21st‑century outcome [IPCC AR6 Synthesis 2023].
- AI/x‑risk expert views: ML researchers’ 2022 survey median 5% chance that long‑run impact of advanced AI is “extremely bad (e.g., human extinction)” [Grace et al., 2022]. Ord’s personal existential‑risk estimates this century: unaligned AI 10%, engineered pandemics 3%, nuclear war 0.1%, climate change 0.1% (extinction or permanent collapse) [Ord 2020].
- Population/resilience: ~8.1 billion humans globally dispersed across diverse geographies as of 2024 [UN DESA WPP 2024], increasing odds of survival pockets under catastrophes.
- Opinion polls: 2008 Oxford GCR conference informal poll median 19% extinction by 2100; authors cautioned strong selection effects (“grain of salt”) [FHI 2008].
