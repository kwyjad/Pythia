- Record benchmark: Oldest verified human lifespan = 122 years 164 days (Jeanne Calment, died 1997-08-04). Source: Guinness World Records (1997; record page).
- Recent extremes: No one has surpassed 122 through 2024. Notables: Kane Tanaka died 2022-04-19 at 119y; Lucile Randon died 2023-01-17 at 118y. Sources: Guinness (2022, 2023); GRG tables/Wikipedia.
- Oldest living ages lately: Since late 1990s, the “oldest living person” has typically been 114–118. Example: Maria Branyas Morera (b. 1907-03-04) recognized oldest living since 2023-01-17; turned 117 on 2024-03-04. Sources: Guinness/Wikipedia (2023–2024).
- Late-life mortality shape: Death rates rise with age then plateau ≈0.5 annual probability from ~105 onward (Italy data). Implication: No hard age cutoff, but survival beyond 115–120 remains very rare. Source: Barbi et al., Science (2018).
- “Hard limit” debate: Dong, Milholland & Vijg argued an effective limit near ~115 based on record plateaus (Nature, 2016). Counter-analyses using extreme value theory find no fixed upper bound. Sources: Dong et al., Nature (2016); Rootzén & Zholud, Extremes (2017).
- EVT projections for this century: Multiple studies conclude breaking 122 is plausible this century, but ages ≥130 are extremely unlikely under current mortality:
  - Rootzén & Zholud: No finite limit; 130 this century “extremely unlikely.” Extremes (2017).
  - Reviews/analyses since 2018 echo: exceed 122–125 plausible; ≥130 very unlikely without mortality change. Sources: Barbi et al., Science (2018); subsequent EVT/demography syntheses (2017–2021).
- Scale of “draws”: Centenarians projected to rise from ~0.5 million (2015) to ~25 million by 2100 (world). More at-risk individuals increases odds of extreme ages. Source: UN DESA, World Population Prospects (2019 report; reiterated 2022 revision).

Decision-relevance:
- Baseline for Jan 1, 2100 oldest living age is governed by: (a) current extreme-age hazards (plateau ~0.5/yr after 105), (b) much larger centenarian/supercentenarian counts by 2100 (UN), and (c) lack of observed increases in maximum verified ages since 1997 (Guinness) absent breakthrough mortality reductions at 110+. 
- Synthesizing the literature: Exceeding the 122 record by 2100 is plausible; ages ≥130 are assessed as very unlikely without major late-life mortality breakthroughs. Sources as above.
