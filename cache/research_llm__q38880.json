  "text": "### Reference class & base rates\n- **Major US labor strikes**: Historically, the US sees around 20-30 major labor strikes annually. Limitations include variability in strike causes and evolving labor dynamics.\n- **Strikes involving technological change**: Strikes specifically citing technology as a primary concern are less frequent, with only a few notable cases in recent years.\n- **Strikes in entertainment/media**: This sector has seen increased strike activity due to technological impacts, notably AI, with 2-3 major strikes in the past few years.\n\n### Recent developments (timeline bullets)\n- [2025-09-09] ↑ — SAG-AFTRA election highlights AI concerns, indicating ongoing union focus on AI issues.\n- [2025-09-09] ↑ — OpenAI's film project underscores AI's growing role in media, potentially fueling labor unrest.\n\n### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)\n- **AI adoption in media**: Large — Increasing AI use in content creation threatens jobs, driving strike likelihood.\n- **Union leadership stance**: Moderate — Aggressive leadership could push for more strikes.\n- **Public sentiment on AI**: Moderate — Rising public concern over AI's impact on jobs may bolster strike support.\n- **Legal and policy frameworks**: Small — New regulations could either mitigate or exacerbate strike triggers.\n- **Economic conditions**: Moderate — Economic downturns often increase labor unrest.\n\n### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)\n- **AI as a focal point**: Unlike past strikes, AI is a central issue, not just a peripheral concern.\n- **Rapid technological change**: The pace of AI development is faster than previous technological shifts.\n- **Union strategies**: Current union strategies are more proactive in addressing AI threats.\n- **Media sector focus**: The entertainment industry is particularly vulnerable to AI disruptions.\n\n### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)\n- **Prior**: Assume a prior of 2-3 strikes with AI as a primary concern, based on recent trends (equivalent n = 5).\n- **Evidence mapping**:\n  - ↑ Large — Increased AI adoption in media.\n  - ↑ Moderate — Union leadership focusing on AI issues.\n  - ↑ Small — Public concern over AI job impacts.\n  - ↓ Small — Potential regulatory interventions.\n- **Net effect**: The posterior should move up moderately, suggesting a higher likelihood of AI-related strikes in 2029.\n\n### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)\n- **UP indicators**:\n  - Increased AI adoption announcements in media.\n  - Union leadership changes favoring aggressive AI stances.\n  - Rising public discourse on AI job impacts.\n- **DOWN indicators**:\n  - New regulations mitigating AI job threats.\n  - Economic improvements reducing labor unrest.\n  - Successful negotiations preempting strikes.\n\n### Caveats & pitfalls\n- **Uncertainty in AI adoption rates**: Rapid changes could alter strike dynamics.\n- **Data gaps**: Limited historical data on AI-specific strikes.\n- **Deception risks**: Misleading narratives about AI's impact.\n- **Regime changes**: Political shifts could influence labor policies.\n- **Definitional gotchas**: Ambiguity in what constitutes AI-related demands.\n\nFinal Research Summary: The likelihood of major US labor strikes in 2029 with AI as a primary concern is moderately higher than historical base rates, driven by increasing AI adoption and union focus on AI issues.",
