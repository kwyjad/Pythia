  "text": "### Reference class & base rates\n- **Supercentenarians (110+ years old):** As of 2023, there are fewer than 100 verified supercentenarians worldwide. Base rate: extremely low probability of reaching 115+.\n- **Centenarians (100+ years old):** Approximately 573,000 centenarians globally in 2023. Base rate: low probability of reaching 110+.\n- **Limitations:** Data on extreme ages is sparse and subject to verification challenges.\n\n### Recent developments (timeline bullets)\n- [2025-09-08] ↓ — Studies show life expectancy gains have slowed significantly since 1939, limiting future longevity increases.\n- [2025-09-06] ↑ — Global aging population projected to increase, potentially driving interest in longevity research.\n\n### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)\n- **Medical advancements:** Moderate; potential breakthroughs in geroscience could extend lifespan.\n- **Public health improvements:** Small; most gains already realized in developed countries.\n- **Genetic factors:** Moderate; some individuals have genetic predispositions for longevity.\n- **Lifestyle factors:** Small; diet, exercise, and social engagement can contribute to longer life.\n- **Environmental factors:** Small; pollution and climate change may negatively impact longevity.\n\n### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)\n- **Slowing life expectancy gains:** Recent studies indicate a deceleration in longevity improvements.\n- **Aging population:** Larger proportion of elderly may drive more research into extending life.\n- **Technological advancements:** Potential for breakthroughs in biotechnology and medicine.\n- **Policy focus:** Increased attention on healthcare and pension systems due to aging demographics.\n\n### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)\n- **Prior:** Low probability of anyone reaching 120+ years by 2100; equivalent n = 50.\n- **Evidence mapping:**\n  - ↓ Large — Slowing life expectancy gains since 1939.\n  - ↑ Moderate — Potential for medical breakthroughs.\n  - ↓ Small — Current life expectancy trends in developed countries.\n  - ↑ Small — Increased focus on longevity research.\n- **Net effect:** Posterior should move slightly down due to strong evidence of slowing gains.\n\n### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)\n- **UP indicators:**\n  - Breakthroughs in anti-aging research.\n  - Increased funding for longevity studies.\n  - New genetic discoveries related to lifespan.\n- **DOWN indicators:**\n  - Continued stagnation in life expectancy data.\n  - Lack of significant medical advancements.\n  - Rising environmental health risks.\n\n### Caveats & pitfalls\n- **Uncertainty in future breakthroughs:** Unpredictable nature of scientific advancements.\n- **Data gaps:** Limited reliable data on extreme ages.\n- **Verification challenges:** Difficulty in verifying ages of supercentenarians.\n- **Regime changes:** Shifts in healthcare policy could impact longevity.\n- **Definitional gotchas:** Variability in defining \"oldest living person.\"\n\nFinal Research Summary: Current evidence suggests a slowing in life expectancy gains, making it unlikely for the oldest living person in 2100 to significantly exceed current records. However, potential medical breakthroughs could alter this trajectory.",
