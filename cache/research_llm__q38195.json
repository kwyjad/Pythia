  "text": "### Reference class & base rates\n- **Reference Class 1**: Major US labor strikes involving technological change. Base rate: ~5–10 strikes per year. Limitation: Not all tech changes are as disruptive as AI.\n- **Reference Class 2**: Strikes specifically citing AI concerns. Base rate: 1–2 per year since 2023. Limitation: Limited historical data.\n- **Reference Class 3**: Strikes in the entertainment industry. Base rate: ~2–4 per year. Limitation: Industry-specific dynamics may not generalize.\n\n### Recent developments (timeline bullets)\n- [2025-09-09] ↑ — SAG-AFTRA election highlights AI concerns, indicating ongoing union focus on AI issues.\n- [2025-09-09] ↑ — OpenAI's film project underscores AI's growing role in entertainment, potentially increasing strike motivations.\n\n### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)\n- **AI Adoption**: Large — Rapid AI integration in industries could trigger protective strikes.\n- **Union Strength**: Moderate — Stronger unions may lead to more frequent strikes.\n- **Public Awareness**: Moderate — Increased awareness of AI's impact could drive strike support.\n- **Regulatory Environment**: Small — Changes in labor laws or AI regulations could influence strike likelihood.\n- **Economic Conditions**: Moderate — Economic downturns may increase strike frequency as job security concerns rise.\n\n### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)\n- **AI-Specific Concerns**: Strikes are increasingly focused on AI, unlike past tech changes.\n- **Industry Focus**: Entertainment industry is a hotspot for AI-related strikes.\n- **Union Strategies**: Unions are adopting more aggressive stances on AI protections.\n- **Public Sentiment**: Growing public concern about AI's impact on jobs and creativity.\n\n### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)\n- **Prior**: Assume a prior of 2 strikes in 2029 with an equivalent n of 10.\n- **Evidence mapping**:\n  - ↑ Large — Ongoing union focus on AI issues.\n  - ↑ Moderate — OpenAI's film project as a catalyst for industry concern.\n  - ↑ Small — Public awareness and sentiment shifts.\n- **Net effect**: Posterior should move up moderately, suggesting a higher likelihood of AI-related strikes in 2029.\n\n### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)\n- **UP indicators**:\n  - Increased union rhetoric on AI.\n  - New AI projects in sensitive industries.\n  - Legislative actions on AI labor protections.\n- **DOWN indicators**:\n  - Successful AI-labor agreements without strikes.\n  - Economic improvements reducing strike motivations.\n  - Decreased media focus on AI job threats.\n\n### Caveats & pitfalls\n- **Uncertainty**: Rapid AI advancements could change dynamics unpredictably.\n- **Data Gaps**: Limited historical data on AI-specific strikes.\n- **Deception Risks**: Misleading narratives about AI's impact could skew perceptions.\n- **Regime Changes**: Shifts in political or economic conditions could alter strike likelihood.\n- **Definitional Gotchas**: Ambiguities in what constitutes \"AI-related\" demands.\n\nFinal Research Summary: The likelihood of major US labor strikes in 2029 citing generative AI as a primary concern is increasing, driven by ongoing union focus and AI's expanding role in industries like entertainment. Watch for union rhetoric and new AI projects as leading indicators.",
