# Resolver Pipeline Overview

This page provides a guided tour of the Resolver data pipeline from the first connector call to the publication of exports and frozen monthly snapshots. It is intended for contributors who need to understand how staging inputs, validation, precedence, and ReliefWeb PDF parsing fit together.

## Pipeline stages

- **Connector ingestion**  
  Entry points live under `resolver/ingestion/*_client.py` and are orchestrated by [`resolver/ingestion/run_all_stubs.py`](../ingestion/run_all_stubs.py). Each connector writes a canonical CSV under `resolver/staging/`. The ReliefWeb client also drives the PDF selector when `RELIEFWEB_ENABLE_PDF=1`; see [ReliefWeb PDF](reliefweb_pdf.md).
- **ReliefWeb PDF branch**  
  [`resolver/ingestion/reliefweb_client.py`](../ingestion/reliefweb_client.py) hydrates report metadata, scores attachments, extracts text via [`resolver/ingestion/_pdf_text.py`](../ingestion/_pdf_text.py), and writes `resolver/staging/reliefweb_pdf.csv` plus manifest entries when the branch is enabled.
- **Schema validation**  
  Staging CSVs are checked against [`resolver/tools/schema.yml`](../tools/schema.yml) via [`resolver/tests/test_staging_schema_all.py`](../tests/test_staging_schema_all.py). A generated [SCHEMAS.md](../../SCHEMAS.md) provides column-level detail for exports and staging contracts.
- **Delta preparation**  
  Connectors output level values, but Resolver consumes monthly "new" deltas. Scripts such as [`resolver/tools/make_deltas.py`](../tools/make_deltas.py) and in-connector logic (for ReliefWeb PDFs) compute the month-over-month differences, including tier-2 ReliefWeb `series_semantics="new"` rows.
- **Precedence engine**  
  [`resolver/tools/precedence_engine.py`](../tools/precedence_engine.py) ranks candidates using tier policy, recency, completeness, and overrides. The logic is documented in [Precedence policy](precedence.md) and the governance appendix.
- **Exports**  
  [`resolver/tools/export_facts.py`](../tools/export_facts.py) consolidates staging inputs into `resolver/exports/facts.csv`, while [`resolver/tools/validate_facts.py`](../tools/validate_facts.py) enforces schema and registry rules before precedence runs.
- **Snapshots**  
  The freezer [`resolver/tools/freeze_snapshot.py`](../tools/freeze_snapshot.py) writes immutable monthly bundles (`resolver/snapshots/YYYY-MM`) for downstream analytics, dashboards, and the forecast resolver.

- **Batch resolution** — Use `POST /resolve_batch` or `resolver/cli/resolver_cli.py batch-resolve --in queries.csv --out results.jsonl` to resolve multiple `(country, hazard, month, series)` questions in one call. The resolver automatically balances between DuckDB and CSV/Parquet backends based on availability.

## Series routing

Resolver exposes two user-facing series:

- **`series=stock`** queries the `facts_resolved` table and returns the stock value for the cutoff month (latest `as_of_date` on or before the cutoff).
- **`series=new`** queries the `facts_deltas` table and returns the month-over-month delta (`value_new`) for the cutoff month using the latest qualifying `as_of` timestamp.

If the requested series has no data, Resolver does **not** fall back to the other series unless the operator explicitly opts in by setting `RESOLVER_ALLOW_SERIES_FALLBACK=1`. Both the CLI and API surface the `series_returned` field so clients can verify which series satisfied the request.
