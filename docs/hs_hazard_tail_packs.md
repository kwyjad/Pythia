# HS Hazard Tail Packs

Hazard Tail Packs (HTP) are hazard-specific follow-up evidence bundles generated by Horizon Scanner (HS) when Regime Change (RC) is elevated. They capture targeted research outputs so downstream Research can reuse evidence without rerunning web research.

## When they are generated

- Generated only for RC Level **2–3**.
- Limited to a maximum of **2 hazards per country**.

## Table schema (DuckDB)

Stored in `hs_hazard_tail_packs` with one row per `(hs_run_id, iso3, hazard_code)`.

- `hs_run_id`: HS run identifier.
- `iso3`: ISO3 country code (uppercased).
- `hazard_code`: HS hazard code (uppercased).
- `rc_level`: Regime Change severity level.
- `rc_score`: Regime Change score.
- `rc_direction`: Direction of change (up/down/mixed/unclear).
- `rc_window`: Regime Change window label.
- `query`: Hazard-tail query used to collect sources.
- `report_markdown`: Markdown report for the hazard tail pack.
- `sources_json`: JSON list of sources backing the report.
- `grounded`: Whether grounding passed for the pack.
- `grounding_debug_json`: JSON debugging payload for grounding.
- `structural_context`: Optional structural context text.
- `recent_signals_json`: JSON list of recent signals captured with the pack.
- `created_at`: Insert timestamp (defaults to current time).

## How Research uses them

Research pulls hazard tail packs during Phase A (research injection only) to seed evidence context for hazard-specific questions. The tail pack content is reused directly to avoid repeated web research runs.
