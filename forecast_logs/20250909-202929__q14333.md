## MODEL REASONING (RAW)
### OpenRouter-Default [openai/gpt-4o]
```
To forecast the age of the oldest living person in 2100, we will follow the structured approach outlined:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from the current age of the oldest living person, Maria Branyas, who is 115 years old. Historically, the maximum verified age is 122 years (Jeanne Calment). The base rate distribution is centered around these ages, with a mean of approximately 115-120 years and a variance reflecting the rarity of reaching such ages.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation reflects historical trends where very few individuals reach ages beyond 115. The base rate is appropriate given the rarity of supercentenarians.
   - Differences: Advances in medical technology and increased research into longevity could potentially extend maximum ages, but the slowing gains in life expectancy suggest limited impact.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Slowing life expectancy gains (‚Üì): Strong evidence that reduces the likelihood of significant increases in maximum age.
   - Potential medical breakthroughs (‚Üë): Moderate evidence that could increase the likelihood of higher maximum ages.
   - Increased focus on longevity research (‚Üë): Small positive impact.
   - Current life expectancy trends (‚Üì): Small negative impact.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Low probability of reaching 120+ years.
   - Likelihood: Slowing gains strongly suggest a downward adjustment, while potential breakthroughs provide a moderate upward push.
   - Posterior: The mean shifts slightly downward from the prior, with a slight increase in variance to account for potential breakthroughs.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for breakthroughs. Consider the possibility of unexpected scientific advancements.
   - Alternative scenario: A breakthrough in anti-aging could significantly increase the maximum age, but this is speculative.
   - Adjustments: Slightly widen the distribution to account for tail risks and uncertainties.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect a slightly conservative estimate with room for potential breakthroughs.

P10: 115  
P20: 117  
P40: 120  
P60: 122  
P80: 125  
P90: 128

# Forecasting the Age of the Oldest Living Person in 2100

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the historical record of maximum human lifespan:

- The oldest verified human ever was Jeanne Calment who died at 122 years and 164 days (1997)
- The current oldest living person is Maria Branyas at 115 years old (as of 2023)
- Over the past century, the record for oldest living person has typically ranged between 114-122 years

Based on this historical data, I'll use a prior distribution centered around 122 years (the all-time record), with a standard deviation of approximately 4 years. This reflects that while we've seen people reach 122, it's extremely rare, and most "oldest living person" records cluster in the 114-119 range.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Biological limits to human aging appear relatively stable despite increases in average life expectancy
- The gap between maximum lifespan and average lifespan has remained large
- Genetic factors continue to play a significant role in extreme longevity

**Differences from base case:**
- By 2100, we'll have had 75+ more years of medical advancement than today
- Aging research is receiving increased funding and scientific attention
- Potential for breakthroughs in geroscience that specifically target aging mechanisms
- Larger global population means more statistical chances for extreme outliers
- Climate change and environmental factors may introduce new health challenges

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for higher values:**
- Growing aging population driving interest in longevity research (moderate upward push)
- Potential for breakthroughs in biotechnology and medicine (strong upward push)
- Increased focus on longevity research (moderate upward push)
- Larger global population providing more statistical opportunities for outliers (small upward push)

**Evidence for lower values:**
- Studies showing life expectancy gains have slowed significantly since 1939 (strong downward push)
- Current life expectancy trends in developed countries showing plateaus (moderate downward push)
- Limited progress in extending maximum lifespan despite medical advances (strong downward push)
- Environmental factors and climate change potentially negatively impacting longevity (small downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 122 years (SD = 4 years), I'll update based on the evidence:

**First update - slowing life expectancy gains:**
This provides strong evidence that maximum lifespan increases will be limited. This shifts my distribution downward by approximately 1-2 years, to a mean of ~120-121 years.

**Second update - potential medical breakthroughs:**
While current trends show limited progress, the potential for breakthroughs in geroscience by 2100 is significant. This shifts the distribution upward and widens it, adding 3-5 years to the mean and increasing variance. New mean: ~124-125 years.

**Third update - larger population providing more statistical opportunities:**
With a larger global population, we have more chances to observe extreme outliers. This slightly shifts the right tail of the distribution, increasing the mean by ~1 year to 125-126 years.

My posterior distribution now has a mean around 125-126 years, with increased variance compared to my prior, reflecting the uncertainty about potential breakthroughs.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for radical life extension technologies
- I might be overestimating the biological limits to human lifespan
- The Metaculus community forecast suggests I might be too conservative
- I haven't fully accounted for potential "black swan" medical breakthroughs

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Radical breakthrough scenario: CRISPR gene editing or similar technologies might enable targeted repair of cellular aging mechanisms, potentially pushing maximum lifespan to 140+ years
- Stagnation scenario: No significant breakthroughs occur, and maximum lifespan remains capped around 120 years
- Decline scenario: Environmental factors or new diseases reduce maximum lifespan below current levels

After considering these alternatives, I should widen my distribution to account for greater uncertainty, particularly in the upper tail.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 119
P20: 122
P40: 126
P60: 130
P80: 136
P90: 142

### Gemini [gemini-2.5-pro]
```
Here is my probabilistic forecast for the age of the oldest living person in 2100.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate base rate is the historical record of the maximum verified human age. The all-time record is held by Jeanne Calment at 122 years. In recent decades, the oldest living person has typically been in the 115-119 year range. This historical data suggests a distribution centered around the current maximums, with a tail for the possibility of breaking the record. My prior distribution, based on this historical reference class, would have a median around 119 years, with a plausible range (P10-P90) of 116 to 125. This reflects the observed plateau in maximum lifespan since Calment's death in 1997.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The forecast period (2025-2100) differs from the historical base case in two critical ways:
- **Slowing Gains:** The research report notes that gains in average life expectancy have decelerated. This is a significant difference from the 20th century and suggests that pushing the maximum age will be harder than in the past. This factor pushes the forecast down.
- **Technological Potential:** We are at the cusp of major advances in biotechnology, geroscience, and AI-driven medicine. The 75-year horizon to 2100 provides a long runway for a breakthrough that could fundamentally alter the human aging process. This is a major difference from the past and creates potential for a significant upward shift, particularly in the right tail of the distribution.

The core of the forecast is the tension between these two opposing forces: observed stagnation versus speculative but high-impact breakthroughs.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence to update my prior:
- **Slowing Life Expectancy Gains (‚Üì Large):** This is strong, empirical evidence. It makes outcomes similar to or only slightly above the current record of 122 more likely. It lowers the probability of extreme outcomes (130+).
- **Potential for Medical Breakthroughs (‚Üë Moderate):** This is speculative but would be transformative. It doesn't significantly raise the median, as a breakthrough is not guaranteed, but it substantially fattens the right tail of the distribution, making ages like 130 or 140 more plausible than they would be otherwise.
- **Metaculus Community Forecast (‚Üë Large):** The Metaculus community predicts a median of ~130 years and assigns a 66% probability to the age being 125 or greater. This is a strong signal from a well-regarded forecasting platform, suggesting that informed forecasters are heavily weighting the potential for technological breakthroughs. This evidence provides a strong upward pull on my entire distribution.
- **Growing Pool of Elderly (‚Üë Small):** A larger global population of centenarians increases the statistical chance of an outlier, providing a slight, steady upward pressure on the maximum age, even without medical breakthroughs.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My prior was anchored to historical data, with a median of 119. The evidence of slowing gains reinforces this conservative stance. However, the Metaculus forecast is a powerful counterpoint, suggesting my prior is too anchored to the past and undervalues future technological progress.

Posterior ‚àù Prior √ó Likelihoods

I will perform a conceptual update. My prior (median ~119) is pulled strongly upwards by the Metaculus data (median ~130). I will not adopt the Metaculus view wholesale, as it may be over-optimistic, but I must adjust significantly from my initial position. I will compromise by setting my posterior median significantly higher than my prior, but lower than the Metaculus median.

My posterior distribution will be centered around a median of **126 years**. This new median reflects a belief that it is more likely than not that Jeanne Calment's record will be broken, but not by the large margin the Metaculus community expects. The distribution will be wide and right-skewed, reflecting the high uncertainty: the downside is capped by biological realities (stagnation), while the upside (breakthroughs) has a much longer tail.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be wrong in several ways:
- **Overly Optimistic:** I have heavily weighted the speculative potential for breakthroughs, largely influenced by the Metaculus signal. If aging proves to be an intractable problem, the "slowing gains" trend will dominate, and the oldest person in 2100 may not even be as old as Jeanne Calment (122). My P20 at 121 accounts for this possibility.
- **Overly Conservative:** The 75-year timeframe is vast in technological terms. A true "cure" for aging, if developed by 2060, could allow someone to live to be 140 or 150 by 2100. My P90 of 138 might be too low if such a radical breakthrough occurs.
- **Black Swans:** Global catastrophes (climate change, pandemics, war) could reverse longevity trends entirely. However, the single oldest person is likely to be among the most privileged and insulated from such effects.

My final distribution attempts to balance these risks. The median at 126 is a substantial increase over the current record, but far from the more extreme techno-optimist scenarios. The wide P10-P90 range (119 to 138) explicitly acknowledges the deep uncertainty. The right-skew of the distribution reflects that the potential for a surprisingly high outcome is greater than the potential for a surprisingly low one.

### Final Percentiles
P10: 119
P20: 121
P40: 124
P60: 128
P80: 133
P90: 138
