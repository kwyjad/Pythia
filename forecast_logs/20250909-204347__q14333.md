## MODEL REASONING (RAW)
### OpenRouter-Default [openai/gpt-4o]
```
To forecast the age of the oldest living person in 2100, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from the current age of the oldest living person, Maria Branyas, who is 115 years old. Historically, the maximum verified age is 122 years (Jeanne Calment). Given the rarity of supercentenarians, the base rate for reaching 120+ is extremely low. The prior distribution is centered around 115-120 years, with a long tail extending slightly beyond 122 due to potential future advancements.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation reflects historical trends where very few individuals reach ages beyond 115. The base rate is consistent with the rarity of supercentenarians.
   - Differences: Advances in medicine and biotechnology could potentially extend maximum lifespans, but recent data shows a slowing in life expectancy gains, which may limit these extensions.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Slowing life expectancy gains (‚Üì): Strong evidence suggests a deceleration in longevity improvements, making it less likely for someone to reach significantly higher ages.
   - Potential medical breakthroughs (‚Üë): Moderate potential for breakthroughs in geroscience could increase the likelihood of higher ages.
   - Increased focus on longevity research (‚Üë): Small positive impact due to more research and funding.
   - Current life expectancy trends (‚Üì): Small negative impact as most gains have been realized in developed countries.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Low probability of reaching 120+ years.
   - Likelihood: Slowing gains strongly suggest a downward adjustment, while potential breakthroughs provide a moderate upward push.
   - Posterior: The distribution shifts slightly downward due to the strong evidence of slowing gains, but retains a long tail for potential breakthroughs.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for unexpected breakthroughs in biotechnology.
   - Tail risks: Consider the possibility of a significant medical breakthrough that could dramatically extend lifespans.
   - Alternative forecast: A more optimistic scenario could place the P90 at 125 years, assuming major advancements in anti-aging research.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the most likely outcomes while accounting for tail risks.

P10: 115  
P20: 117  
P40: 119  
P60: 121  
P80: 123  
P90: 125

# Forecasting the Age of the Oldest Living Person in 2100

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the historical record of maximum human lifespan:

- The oldest verified human ever was Jeanne Calment who died at 122 years and 164 days (1997)
- The current oldest living person is Maria Branyas at 115 years old (as of 2023)
- Over the past century, the record for oldest living person has typically ranged between 114-122 years

Based on this historical data, I'll use a prior distribution centered around 122 years (the all-time record) with a standard deviation of approximately 4 years. This reflects that while we've seen someone reach 122, it's extremely rare, and most "oldest living person" records cluster in the 114-119 range.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Biological limits to human aging appear relatively stable despite increases in average life expectancy
- The gap between maximum lifespan and average lifespan has remained large
- Genetic factors continue to play a significant role in extreme longevity

**Differences from base case:**
- By 2100 (75 years from now), medical technology will likely be significantly more advanced
- Focused research on aging and longevity is increasing
- The global population will be larger, increasing the statistical probability of outliers
- Climate change and environmental factors may introduce new stressors

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for higher values:**
- Increasing global population means more potential outliers (small upward push)
- Potential breakthroughs in geroscience and anti-aging research (moderate upward push)
- Increased focus on longevity research due to aging demographics (small upward push)
- 75 years is a long time for medical advances (moderate upward push)

**Evidence for lower values:**
- Studies show life expectancy gains have slowed significantly since 1939 (strong downward push)
- Maximum lifespan has shown remarkable stability despite medical advances (strong downward push)
- Current life expectancy trends in developed countries show plateauing (moderate downward push)
- Environmental factors and climate change may negatively impact longevity (small downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 122 years (SD = 4 years), I'll update based on the evidence:

The strongest evidence is the slowing of life expectancy gains and the historical stability of maximum lifespan. This suggests that biological limits are difficult to overcome, even with medical advances.

However, the long timeframe (75 years) and potential for breakthroughs in aging research provide some counterbalance.

Updating my prior:
- The mean shifts upward from 122 to approximately 126 years
- The variance increases slightly due to uncertainty about future medical breakthroughs
- The distribution becomes slightly right-skewed, reflecting the small possibility of dramatic breakthroughs

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for radical life extension technologies
- The research report doesn't mention specific emerging technologies like CRISPR, senolytics, or regenerative medicine
- I might be overweighting historical stability when future breakthroughs could be discontinuous
- The report doesn't address potential societal changes that might affect who receives life-extending treatments

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Radical breakthrough scenario: A major advance in addressing cellular senescence or telomere shortening could push the maximum age to 140+ years
- Stagnation scenario: Environmental stressors and diminishing returns on medical research could keep the maximum age below 120 years
- Bifurcation scenario: Unequal access to life-extending technologies creates a small population with dramatically extended lifespans

After considering these alternatives, I should widen my distribution to account for greater uncertainty, particularly in the upper tail.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 118
P20: 121
P40: 125
P60: 129
P80: 135
P90: 142

### Gemini [gemini-2.5-pro]
```
Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the distribution of the age of the oldest living person over the last few decades. The all-time verified record is Jeanne Calment at 122 years, who died in 1997. Since then, the oldest titleholders have typically been in the 115-119 age range (e.g., Kane Tanaka, 119; Maria Branyas, currently 118). This suggests a distribution centered around the recent maximums, but with a tail that includes the Calment outlier.

My prior distribution, before considering specific future-oriented evidence, is centered at 119 years. I'll set a wide 80% confidence interval to reflect the long forecast horizon (75 years), from 115 (a typical recent value) to 125 (breaking the all-time record by a few years). This prior acknowledges the recent plateau around 115-119 but allows for the possibility of new records.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The future situation (2025-2100) differs from the historical reference period in several key ways:
- **Similarities:** The fundamental genetic and biological constraints on human aging remain. The oldest person will likely still be an extreme statistical outlier from a very large global population.
- **Differences (Headwinds):** The strong trend of increasing life expectancy seen in the 20th century has slowed or plateaued, particularly in developed nations. This suggests the "low-hanging fruit" from public health and basic medicine has been picked, making further gains in maximum lifespan harder to achieve.
- **Differences (Tailwinds):** The 75-year forecast horizon provides ample time for significant, currently unforeseen medical breakthroughs. Fields like geroscience, AI-driven drug discovery, and genetic engineering have the potential (though not the guarantee) to fundamentally alter the aging process, creating upside risk not fully captured by historical data. The growing global population of elderly people also increases the political and economic incentives for such research.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the research report:
- **Slowing life expectancy gains (Large ‚Üì):** This is the strongest piece of empirical evidence. It suggests that the forces that pushed the maximum age up are weakening. This strongly pulls the forecast down from a simple extrapolation of past trends and makes outcomes above 122 less likely than they might otherwise seem.
- **Potential for medical breakthroughs (Moderate ‚Üë):** This is the primary source of upside uncertainty. While speculative, a 75-year window makes a breakthrough in anti-aging technology plausible. This evidence doesn't raise the median much, but it significantly fattens the right tail of the distribution, making outcomes like 125 or even 130 possible, if unlikely.
- **Metaculus Community Forecast (Strong Anchor):** The Metaculus median of 119 with an interquartile range of [117, 122] is a powerful piece of evidence. It represents the aggregated judgment of many forecasters considering the same data. It suggests my prior is well-calibrated but that the upper tail might be slightly less extreme than a pure techno-optimist might believe (their 75th percentile is at the all-time record of 122).
- **Other factors (Small effects):** Increased research funding (small ‚Üë), environmental risks (small ‚Üì), and public health saturation (small ‚Üì) are secondary factors that largely balance each other out or reinforce the primary evidence.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Median ~119, 80% CI [115, 125].
- **Update 1 (Slowing Gains):** The strong evidence of a plateau lowers my confidence in the upper end. I adjust the median down slightly to 118.5 and pull the P90 down from 125 to 123.
- **Update 2 (Breakthrough Potential):** This counteracts the first update, specifically in the tail. It suggests that while the median outcome is lower, the distribution should be right-skewed. I'll push the P90 back up to 125 to account for the small but real chance of a paradigm-shifting discovery.
- **Update 3 (Metaculus Anchor):** The Metaculus forecast of [117, 119, 122] for P25, P50, P75 provides a strong calibration point. My median of 118.5 is slightly more pessimistic, which I find justified by the report's emphasis on slowing gains. My upper range is slightly more aggressive (P80 at 122, P90 at 125), reflecting a slightly higher weight on the long-shot breakthrough potential over 75 years.

The resulting posterior distribution is centered at 118.5. It is right-skewed, with most of the probability mass concentrated between 116 and 122, but with a tail extending to 125 and beyond to account for breakthroughs.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I could be wrong in two main ways. First, I might be underestimating the potential for radical breakthroughs. In 75 years, technologies like AI and CRISPR could solve aging in a way that makes 125 seem quaint. This would mean my entire distribution should be shifted significantly higher. However, the historical difficulty of translating biological research into radical lifespan extension suggests caution. Second, I might be underestimating downside risk. A global catastrophe (climate change, war, pandemic) could reverse health gains, making even 115 a high outcome. My P10 of 114.5 accounts for some of this risk. My final distribution tries to balance the strong evidence of the current plateau against these more speculative, high-impact tail risks. The 20% probability of breaking the all-time record of 122 seems like a reasonable balance between acknowledging the 75-year timescale and respecting the stubbornness of the existing record.

### 6. Final Percentiles
P10: 114.5
P20: 116.0
P40: 118.0
P60: 119.0
P80: 122.0
P90: 125.0
