To forecast the number of major US labor strikes with generative AI as one of their main reasons starting in 2029, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for major US labor strikes annually is around 20-30. However, strikes specifically citing technology as a primary concern are less frequent, with only a few notable cases in recent years. Given the recent trend of 2-3 major strikes in the entertainment/media sector due to AI, we will use this as our base rate for AI-related strikes.
   - Mean/Median: 2.5 strikes, Variance: 1 strike (reflecting some uncertainty).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The entertainment/media sector continues to be heavily impacted by AI, similar to recent years.
   - Differences: AI is now a central issue, with rapid technological change and proactive union strategies, suggesting a potential increase in strike frequency.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Increased AI adoption in media (Large ‚Üë): This significantly raises the likelihood of strikes.
   - Union leadership focus on AI (Moderate ‚Üë): This moderately increases the likelihood.
   - Public concern over AI job impacts (Small ‚Üë): This slightly increases the likelihood.
   - Potential regulatory interventions (Small ‚Üì): This slightly decreases the likelihood.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: 2-3 strikes.
   - Likelihood adjustments: The evidence suggests a moderate increase in the likelihood of strikes.
   - Posterior: Adjusting the prior upwards, we estimate a mean of around 3-4 strikes, with increased variance to account for uncertainty.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The rapid pace of AI adoption could lead to more strikes than anticipated.
   - Alternative scenario: If regulatory frameworks effectively mitigate AI job threats, the number of strikes could be lower.
   - Adjustments: Consider a wider range to account for these uncertainties.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the increased likelihood and uncertainty.

# Forecasting Major US Labor Strikes with Generative AI as a Main Reason in 2029

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **Recent AI-related strikes**: From the background, we've seen 3 major strikes with AI as a primary concern from 2023-2025 (Writers Guild, SAG-AFTRA actors, SAG-AFTRA video game performers). This suggests approximately 1 major AI-related strike per year in recent years.

2. **Major US labor strikes overall**: The research report indicates 20-30 major labor strikes annually in the US historically, with only a small fraction specifically citing technology as a primary concern.

Given these reference classes, I'll establish a prior distribution centered around 2-3 major US labor strikes with generative AI as a main reason in 2029, with significant uncertainty. This aligns with the research report's prior suggestion and extrapolates from the recent trend of approximately 1 AI-related strike per year, with an expectation of modest growth as AI continues to penetrate more industries.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Labor unions continue to exist and use strikes as a negotiation tool
- Generative AI continues to develop and impact various industries
- Entertainment/media sectors remain particularly vulnerable to AI disruption

**Differences from base case:**
- By 2029, generative AI will be significantly more advanced and widespread than in 2023-2025
- More industries beyond entertainment may be affected by generative AI
- Unions will have had several years to develop strategies around AI concerns
- Legal frameworks and regulations regarding AI in the workplace may have evolved
- Public awareness and sentiment about AI's impact on jobs will likely be different

These differences suggest a potential increase in AI-related strikes by 2029, as the technology becomes more pervasive across sectors and potentially threatens more jobs.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting more strikes:**
- Increasing AI adoption in media and other sectors (strong upward push, ~2x likelihood)
- Union leadership focusing on AI issues (moderate upward push, ~1.5x likelihood)
- Public concern over AI job impacts (small upward push, ~1.2x likelihood)
- The pace of AI development is faster than previous technological shifts (moderate upward push, ~1.5x likelihood)
- Current union strategies are becoming more proactive in addressing AI threats (moderate upward push, ~1.5x likelihood)

**Evidence supporting fewer strikes:**
- Potential regulatory interventions mitigating AI job threats (small downward push, ~0.9x likelihood)
- Possibility of successful negotiations preempting strikes (moderate downward push, ~0.7x likelihood)
- Unions and industries may develop standard practices for AI use by 2029 (moderate downward push, ~0.7x likelihood)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior centered at 2-3 strikes, I'll update based on the evidence:

Prior: 2-3 strikes with AI as a primary concern

Update based on increasing AI adoption: 2-3 strikes √ó 2 = 4-6 strikes
Update based on union leadership focus: 4-6 strikes √ó 1.5 = 6-9 strikes
Update based on public concern: 6-9 strikes √ó 1.2 = 7.2-10.8 strikes
Update based on rapid technological change: 7.2-10.8 strikes √ó 1.5 = 10.8-16.2 strikes
Update based on proactive union strategies: 10.8-16.2 strikes √ó 1.5 = 16.2-24.3 strikes

Now adjusting downward:
Update based on regulatory interventions: 16.2-24.3 strikes √ó 0.9 = 14.6-21.9 strikes
Update based on successful negotiations: 14.6-21.9 strikes √ó 0.7 = 10.2-15.3 strikes
Update based on standardized practices: 10.2-15.3 strikes √ó 0.7 = 7.1-10.7 strikes

This suggests a posterior distribution centered around 7-11 strikes, with significant uncertainty.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the continued relevance of AI as a strike issue by 2029. If AI becomes normalized in workplaces, it might generate fewer strikes.
- I might be underestimating the potential for comprehensive AI labor regulations that could preempt strikes.
- The forecast doesn't fully account for potential economic conditions in 2029, which could significantly impact strike frequency.
- I may be overextrapolating from a small sample of recent AI-related strikes.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative forecast might suggest only 2-4 strikes, arguing that:
1. Early AI-related strikes will lead to industry-standard agreements
2. Regulatory frameworks will develop to address AI concerns
3. Workers and industries will adapt to AI integration

However, this alternative seems to underestimate the disruptive potential of increasingly capable AI systems and the likelihood of continued labor concerns as AI penetrates more industries.

Given these considerations, I'll adjust my distribution to be slightly wider and with a lower median to account for these uncertainties.
