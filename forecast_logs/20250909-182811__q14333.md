To forecast the age of the oldest living person in 2100, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from the current age of the oldest living person, Maria Branyas, who is 115 years old. Historically, the maximum verified age has been around 122 years (Jeanne Calment). The base rate distribution is centered around 115-122 years, with a low probability of exceeding 122 years. The variance is high due to the rarity and variability of such extreme ages.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation reflects historical patterns where very few individuals reach extreme ages (115+ years).
   - Differences: Advances in medical research and biotechnology could potentially extend maximum lifespan, but the slowing gains in life expectancy suggest limited impact on extreme ages.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Slowing life expectancy gains (‚Üì): Strong evidence that suggests a lower likelihood of significant increases in maximum age.
   - Potential medical breakthroughs (‚Üë): Moderate evidence that could increase the likelihood of higher maximum ages.
   - Increased focus on longevity research (‚Üë): Small positive impact, as research may lead to incremental improvements.
   - Current life expectancy trends (‚Üì): Small negative impact, as developed countries show stagnation in life expectancy gains.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Low probability of reaching 120+ years by 2100.
   - Likelihood: Slowing gains strongly suggest a downward adjustment, while potential breakthroughs provide a moderate upward adjustment.
   - Posterior: The mean shifts slightly downward from the prior, with a slight increase in variance to account for potential breakthroughs.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast may underestimate the potential for unforeseen breakthroughs in biotechnology.
   - Tail risks: Consider the possibility of a breakthrough that significantly extends lifespan, though this remains speculative.
   - Alternative forecast: A more optimistic scenario could place the P90 at 125 years, assuming significant medical advancements.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecast percentiles are adjusted to reflect the most likely outcomes, with consideration for tail risks and uncertainties.

P10: 115  
P20: 117  
P40: 120  
P60: 122  
P80: 124  
P90: 126

# Forecasting the Age of the Oldest Living Person in 2100

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the historical record of maximum human lifespan:

- The oldest verified human ever was Jeanne Calment who died at 122 years and 164 days (1997)
- The current oldest living person is Maria Branyas at 115 years old (2023)
- Over the past century, the record for oldest living person has typically ranged between 115-122 years

The appropriate base rate distribution would be centered around 120-122 years, with a relatively narrow spread. I'll use a mean of 121 years with a standard deviation of about 3 years, reflecting the historical stability of maximum human lifespan despite significant increases in average life expectancy.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Biological limits to human aging appear relatively stable
- Maximum lifespan has not increased proportionally with average life expectancy
- Verified supercentenarians remain extremely rare

**Differences from base case:**
- By 2100, we'll have 75+ more years of medical advancement
- Potential for breakthroughs in geroscience and anti-aging research
- Larger global population increases the statistical likelihood of outliers
- Improved verification methods may identify more genuine supercentenarians

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for higher values:**
- Growing aging population and increased focus on longevity research (moderate upward push)
- Potential for medical/biotechnology breakthroughs (strong upward push if realized)
- Larger global population increases statistical chances of extreme outliers (small upward push)

**Evidence for lower values:**
- Studies showing life expectancy gains have slowed significantly since 1939 (strong downward push)
- Current life expectancy trends in developed countries showing plateaus (moderate downward push)
- Limited verified cases of humans exceeding 115 years despite population growth (moderate downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 121 years (SD=3):

First update: Studies showing slowing life expectancy gains
- This provides strong evidence that biological limits are difficult to overcome
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring the lower end of my distribution
- This shifts my distribution downward by ~1 year (new mean: 120 years)

Second update: Potential for medical breakthroughs by 2100
- Given 75+ years of future research, some advances are likely
- Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring the higher end
- This shifts my distribution upward by ~2 years (new mean: 122 years)

Third update: Historical stability of maximum lifespan
- Despite medical advances over the past century, maximum verified age has remained stable
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 favoring stability
- This reduces my variance but keeps the mean similar

My posterior distribution now has a mean around 122 years with a wider standard deviation of ~5 years, reflecting increased uncertainty over the 75-year timeframe.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for radical life extension technologies
- The research report doesn't mention specific breakthrough technologies like CRISPR, nanomedicine, or AI-driven drug discovery
- I might be overweighting historical patterns in a rapidly changing technological landscape

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Radical breakthrough scenario: A major anti-aging breakthrough occurs, pushing maximum lifespan to 150+ years
- Stagnation scenario: No significant advances occur, keeping maximum lifespan around 120 years
- Decline scenario: Environmental factors or global crises reduce maximum lifespan below current levels

The radical breakthrough scenario deserves more weight than I initially gave it. With 75+ years of scientific advancement ahead, the probability of significant anti-aging breakthroughs is non-trivial. I should widen my distribution to account for this possibility.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I'll adjust my distribution to have a wider right tail to account for breakthrough possibilities while maintaining a realistic assessment of biological constraints.
