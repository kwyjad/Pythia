To forecast the number of major US labor strikes with generative AI as one of their main reasons starting in 2029, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate**: The historical average of major US labor strikes annually is around 20-30. However, strikes specifically citing technology as a primary concern are less frequent, with only a few notable cases in recent years. Given the recent trend of 2-3 major strikes in the entertainment/media sector due to AI, we will use this as our base rate for AI-related strikes.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance**: Assume a mean of 2.5 strikes with a variance reflecting moderate uncertainty, say a standard deviation of 1.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities**: The entertainment/media sector continues to be heavily impacted by AI, similar to recent years.
   - **Differences**: The pace of AI development and its centrality in labor disputes is increasing, suggesting a potential increase in strike frequency.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Increased AI adoption in media**: This factor significantly increases the likelihood of strikes, suggesting a higher outcome is more likely.
   - **Union leadership focus on AI**: Moderately increases the likelihood of strikes.
   - **Public concern over AI job impacts**: Slightly increases the likelihood.
   - **Potential regulatory interventions**: Slightly decreases the likelihood.
   - **Net Effect**: The evidence suggests a moderate upward shift from the base rate.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior**: Mean of 2.5 strikes.
   - **Likelihood Adjustments**: Given the evidence, we adjust the mean upward to reflect increased likelihood, perhaps to around 3.5 strikes, with a slightly increased variance to account for uncertainty.
   - **Posterior**: Mean of 3.5 strikes, with a standard deviation of 1.5 to reflect increased uncertainty and potential variability.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of overestimating the impact of AI. Regulatory changes or successful negotiations could mitigate strike numbers.
   - **Tail Risks**: A rapid AI adoption or a significant economic downturn could lead to more strikes than anticipated.
   - **Alternative Forecast**: A more conservative estimate might suggest only a slight increase from the base rate, around 3 strikes.
   - **Adjustment**: Given these considerations, adjust the percentiles to reflect a slightly wider distribution.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the posterior distribution, we calculate the percentiles:
P10: 2
P20: 2.5
P40: 3
P60: 3.5
P80: 4.5
P90: 5

# Forecasting Major US Labor Strikes with Generative AI as a Main Reason in 2029

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **Recent AI-related strikes**: From the background, we've seen 3 major strikes with AI as a primary concern from 2023-2025 (Writers Guild, SAG-AFTRA actors, and SAG-AFTRA video game performers). This suggests approximately 1-1.5 AI-related strikes per year in recent history.

2. **Major US labor strikes overall**: The research report indicates 20-30 major labor strikes annually in the US historically.

3. **Technology-driven strikes**: The report notes that strikes specifically citing technology as a primary concern are less frequent.

Given these reference classes, I'll establish a prior centered around 2-3 major US labor strikes with generative AI as a main reason in 2029, with significant uncertainty. This aligns with the research report's prior suggestion and extrapolates from the recent trend of AI-related strikes.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Labor unions continue to exist and function as they have historically
- Strikes remain a primary tool for labor negotiations
- The entertainment industry remains particularly sensitive to technological disruption

**Differences from base rate:**
- By 2029, generative AI will be significantly more advanced and widespread than in 2023-2025
- More industries beyond entertainment will likely be affected by generative AI
- Unions will have had several years to develop specific strategies around AI concerns
- Some industries may have already established AI-related protections, reducing the need for strikes
- The public and policymakers will have more experience with AI impacts

These differences suggest a potential increase in the number of AI-related strikes as the technology affects more industries, but also potential moderation as some protections become standardized.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting higher numbers of AI-related strikes:**

1. **Increasing AI adoption in media** (Large impact): The research report highlights this as a large factor. As AI becomes more capable of creative work, more jobs will be threatened, making strikes more likely. This makes higher numbers ~2x more likely.

2. **SAG-AFTRA election highlighting AI concerns** (Moderate impact): This indicates ongoing union focus on AI issues through 2025, suggesting continued attention through 2029. This makes higher numbers ~1.5x more likely.

3. **OpenAI's film project** (Moderate impact): This demonstrates AI's growing role in media production, potentially threatening traditional jobs. This makes higher numbers ~1.3x more likely.

4. **Rapid technological change** (Large impact): The pace of AI development is faster than previous technological shifts, potentially affecting more industries by 2029. This makes higher numbers ~2x more likely.

**Evidence supporting lower numbers of AI-related strikes:**

1. **Potential regulatory interventions** (Small impact): By 2029, some regulations may be in place to address AI labor concerns, potentially reducing the need for strikes. This makes lower numbers ~1.2x more likely.

2. **Established precedents** (Moderate impact): The early strikes (2023-2025) may establish precedents that are adopted across industries, reducing the need for future strikes. This makes lower numbers ~1.5x more likely.

3. **Adaptation period** (Moderate impact): By 2029, industries will have had several years to adapt to AI, potentially reducing sudden disruptions that trigger strikes. This makes lower numbers ~1.4x more likely.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior centered at 2-3 strikes with a wide distribution, I'll update based on the evidence:

**First update - Increasing AI adoption and rapid technological change:**
- These factors together make higher numbers approximately 4x more likely (2x √ó 2x)
- This shifts the distribution upward significantly, with a new median around 4-5 strikes

**Second update - Established precedents and adaptation period:**
- These factors make lower numbers approximately 2.1x more likely (1.5x √ó 1.4x)
- This moderates the previous update, bringing the median to around 3-4 strikes

**Third update - Ongoing union focus and AI demonstrations:**
- These factors make higher numbers approximately 1.95x more likely (1.5x √ó 1.3x)
- This shifts the distribution slightly upward again, with a final median around 4 strikes

The posterior distribution is now centered around 4 strikes, with a wider spread than the prior due to the uncertainty about how AI will develop and affect labor markets by 2029.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**

1. **Overestimating AI impact**: I may be overestimating how disruptive AI will be by 2029. If AI progress slows or its capabilities plateau, there may be fewer strikes than expected.

2. **Underestimating adaptation**: Industries and unions might adapt more quickly than expected, establishing standard protections that reduce the need for strikes.

3. **Alternative labor actions**: Unions might use tactics other than strikes (legislation, negotiation) to address AI concerns, which wouldn't count in this forecast.

4. **Economic conditions**: A severe economic downturn by 2029 could either increase labor unrest generally or make workers less willing to strike due to job insecurity.

5. **Definition ambiguity**: What constitutes AI as "one of the main reasons" could be subjective and affect resolution.

**Alternative forecast**: A plausible alternative would be a much lower number (0-1) if AI concerns become routinely addressed in standard labor agreements by 2029, making strikes unnecessary. However, this seems unlikely given the rapid pace of AI development and the historical pattern of technological disruption requiring labor action.

Given these considerations, I should widen my distribution slightly to account for greater uncertainty, particularly in the lower tail.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 1
P20: 2
P40: 3
P60: 4
P80: 6
P90: 8

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the number of major US labor strikes starting in 2029 with generative AI as a main reason. A "major" strike involves 1,000+ workers, per the BLS definition.

The most relevant reference class is the number of such strikes in the recent past. Since generative AI became a major public issue in late 2022, we have observed three such strikes starting between 2023 and mid-2025 (WGA 2023, SAG-AFTRA 2023, SAG-AFTRA Video Games 2024). This gives a rate of approximately 1-2 strikes per year.

I will model my prior distribution using a Poisson distribution, which is suitable for counting events over a fixed interval. A mean (lambda) of 2 strikes per year seems like a reasonable starting point based on this recent history. This prior has a mean of 2, a median between 1 and 2, and a variance of 2. It implies that 0, 1, 2, or 3 strikes are all highly plausible outcomes based on the world as it was in 2023-2025.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The forecast is for 2029, four years from the present (2025). The situation in 2029 is expected to be significantly different from the 2023-2025 base period.

*   **Pace of AI Development**: AI capabilities will be far more advanced and integrated into workflows by 2029, making the technology a more potent and widespread threat to labor.
*   **Diffusion of AI**: The initial AI-related strikes were concentrated in the entertainment industry. By 2029, generative AI's impact will be felt across many other white-collar sectors (e.g., journalism, customer service, software development, logistics), expanding the number of unions and workers potentially affected.
*   **Union Precedent and Strategy**: The 2023 strikes created a powerful precedent. By 2029, many more unions will have developed strategies and specific contract demands related to AI, increasing the number of potential flashpoints during negotiations.

These differences strongly suggest that the rate of AI-related strikes in 2029 will be higher than the 2023-2025 base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the evidence from the research report to update my prior.

*   **‚Üë Large ‚Äî Increased AI adoption in media**: This is the primary driver. As companies move from experimenting with AI to deploying it for cost-saving (i.e., labor reduction), the frequency of disputes will almost certainly increase. This is a strong upward update.
*   **‚Üë Moderate ‚Äî Union leadership focusing on AI**: Unions are actively making AI a central issue. This institutional focus makes it more likely that contract negotiations will hinge on AI protections, and thus more likely that impasses will lead to strikes. This is a moderate upward update.
*   **‚Üë Moderate ‚Äî Spillover to other sectors**: This is a crucial factor not fully captured in the base rate. The threat is no longer confined to Hollywood. Unions like the CWA, NewsGuild, and even the Teamsters (for administrative roles) will likely face similar issues. This significantly increases the pool of potential strikes.
*   **‚Üì Small ‚Äî Potential regulatory interventions**: A key counterforce is the possibility of government regulation that provides baseline protections, reducing the need for unions to strike over these issues. However, given the typical pace of US legislation, the impact by 2029 is likely to be small. This is a minor downward update.

The net effect of the evidence is a strong push upwards from the initial base rate.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My prior was a Poisson distribution with a mean of 2. The evidence, particularly the rapid adoption of AI and its spread to new industries, suggests this mean is too low for 2029.

*   **Conceptual Update**: The base rate of ~1-2 strikes/year came from one primary sector (entertainment). The "spillover" effect could plausibly add 2-3 other major sectors as potential sources of strikes. The increasing pace of adoption acts as a multiplier on the conflict probability within each sector.
*   **Posterior Shape**: I will update my posterior to have a higher central tendency and greater variance. A new mean (lambda) in the range of 3.5 to 4 seems more appropriate for 2029. This shifts the bulk of the probability mass to the 2-5 range, up from the 1-3 range of the prior. The distribution will remain right-skewed, as there is a hard floor at zero but a long tail of possibilities on the high end (e.g., a wave of coordinated strikes).

My posterior distribution is centered around a median of 3-4 strikes, but with significant probability of both lower and higher outcomes.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must challenge my own reasoning for potential biases.

*   **Alternative Scenario (Downward pressure)**: The initial, high-profile strikes of 2023-2024 could serve as such a powerful warning that companies become much more willing to negotiate and concede on AI issues preemptively to avoid costly shutdowns. This "threat effect" could lead to fewer actual strikes than expected. My lower percentiles should account for this possibility.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Upward pressure)**: I might be underestimating the scope of disruption. By 2029, AI could be a central issue in *nearly every* major contract negotiation. If even a fraction of the 20-30 major strikes that happen annually for various reasons have AI as a core component, the number could easily reach the high single digits. My upper percentiles must reflect this "systemic conflict" scenario.
*   **Adjustment**: My initial Poisson(4) model might have tails that are too thin. To account for these alternative scenarios, I will manually widen my final percentile estimates. I will keep the median around 3-4 but increase the P80 and P90 values to reflect the significant upside risk, while ensuring the P10 and P20 acknowledge the "preemption" scenario. My 80% confidence interval (P10-P90) should be wide to reflect the high uncertainty of a 4-year forecast on a rapidly evolving topic.

This leads me to a final distribution that is right-skewed, centered around 3-4, but with a P10 of 1 and a P90 of 8, capturing a wide range of plausible outcomes.
