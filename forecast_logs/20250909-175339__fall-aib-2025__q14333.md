To forecast the age of the oldest living person in 2100, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the age of the oldest living person can be derived from historical data on supercentenarians. As of 2023, the oldest verified age is around 122 years (Jeanne Calment). The base rate distribution is centered around this age with a low probability of exceeding it significantly. The mean/median is approximately 115-120 years, with a variance reflecting the rarity of ages beyond 115.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation reflects historical trends where very few individuals reach ages beyond 115. The base rate is appropriate given the rarity of supercentenarians.
   - Differences: Advances in medical technology and increased focus on longevity research could potentially extend maximum ages, but the slowing gains in life expectancy suggest limited impact.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Slowing life expectancy gains (‚Üì Large): This suggests a lower likelihood of significant increases in maximum age.
   - Potential medical breakthroughs (‚Üë Moderate): This could increase the likelihood of higher maximum ages, but the impact is uncertain.
   - Increased focus on longevity research (‚Üë Small): This provides a slight upward pressure on the potential maximum age.
   - Current life expectancy trends (‚Üì Small): These trends suggest limited increases in maximum age.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Low probability of reaching 120+ years.
   - Likelihood: Slowing gains strongly suggest a downward adjustment, while potential breakthroughs provide a moderate upward adjustment.
   - Posterior: The mean shifts slightly downward due to strong evidence of slowing gains, with a slight increase in variance to account for potential breakthroughs.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast may underestimate the potential for breakthroughs. Consider tail risks of significant medical advancements.
   - Alternative scenario: A breakthrough in anti-aging could lead to a higher maximum age. However, the likelihood of such breakthroughs is uncertain.
   - Adjustments: Increase the upper percentiles slightly to account for potential breakthroughs.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the most likely outcomes while accounting for tail risks.

# Forecasting the Age of the Oldest Living Person in 2100

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use the historical record of maximum human lifespan as my base rate. The verified oldest person ever was Jeanne Calment who lived to 122 years and 164 days (died in 1997). Since then, the oldest living person has typically been between 115-119 years old.

Looking at the data from the past few decades:
- Current oldest: Maria Branyas (115 years as of 2023)
- Recent oldest: Kane Tanaka (119 years, died 2022)
- Jeanne Calment (122 years, died 1997)

The mean maximum age over recent decades has been approximately 117 years, with a standard deviation of about 2-3 years. This forms my prior distribution.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Biological limits to human aging appear relatively stable
- The verified maximum age has remained in the 115-122 range for decades
- The number of supercentenarians remains extremely small

**Differences from base case:**
- By 2100 (75 years from now), medical technology will likely be significantly more advanced
- The global population will be larger, increasing the statistical chance of outliers
- Focused research on longevity and aging may yield breakthroughs
- Climate change and environmental factors could negatively impact longevity

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for higher maximum age:**
- Increasing global population provides more statistical opportunities for extreme outliers (moderate upward push)
- Potential medical breakthroughs in geroscience (moderate upward push)
- Increased focus on longevity research due to aging demographics (small upward push)
- Genetic factors being better understood and potentially modified (small upward push)

**Evidence for lower or stable maximum age:**
- Studies showing life expectancy gains have slowed significantly since 1939 (strong downward push)
- Current life expectancy trends in developed countries showing plateauing (moderate downward push)
- Biological limits to cellular repair and replication (moderate downward push)
- Environmental factors like pollution and climate change (small downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 117 years with a standard deviation of ~3 years:

The strongest evidence is the slowing of life expectancy gains, which suggests biological limits are hard to overcome. This shifts my distribution downward slightly.

However, the potential for medical breakthroughs over a 75-year timeframe and the larger population base push the upper tail of the distribution higher.

The net effect is a slightly right-skewed distribution with:
- A median around 118-119 years (small increase from prior)
- A wider right tail extending to ~130 years for extreme possibilities
- A left tail that doesn't go much below 115 years (as we've consistently seen supercentenarians reach this age)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for radical life extension technologies
- The Metaculus community forecast suggests a higher value than my current estimate
- 75 years is a very long time horizon for technological development
- I might be anchoring too much on current maximum ages

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Breakthrough scenario: CRISPR gene editing or similar technologies could enable targeted repair of aging-related damage, potentially pushing maximum age to 140+ years
- Stagnation scenario: Biological limits prove insurmountable, keeping maximum age around current levels (115-122)
- Decline scenario: Environmental factors or global instability reduce maximum lifespan below current levels

After considering these alternatives, I should widen my distribution to account for the long time horizon and technological uncertainty.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the age of the oldest living person in 2100. A suitable reference class is the historical record of the maximum verified human age. The all-time record is Jeanne Calment at 122 years. In recent decades, the age of the oldest person has typically been in the 114-119 year range. The person who will be the oldest in 2100 is almost certainly alive today (likely aged 25-50).

My prior distribution is based on this historical data, assuming no radical technological shifts. This "stagnation" model suggests that progress in extreme longevity is very slow.
- **Median (P50):** 119 years. This represents a slight increase over the current maximum age, driven by a larger global population (more chances for an outlier) but no fundamental change in aging.
- **Spread:** The distribution is narrow and skewed right. It's very unlikely the maximum age would be lower than today's supercentenarians. I'd set a P10 of 116 and a P90 of 123, which would mean just barely breaking the all-time record.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The fundamental biological processes of aging remain the primary limiting factor, as they have been throughout history.
- **Differences:** The primary difference is the 75-year time horizon (from 2025 to 2100). This is a long period during which scientific and medical advancements could occur. Unlike historical gains in life expectancy driven by public health, future gains in maximum lifespan will likely depend on targeted biotechnological interventions in the aging process itself (geroscience). The increased global focus on an aging population may accelerate research in this area.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the evidence from the research report to update my prior.

- **‚Üì Large ‚Äî Slowing life expectancy gains:** This is strong, empirical evidence that the "low-hanging fruit" has been picked. It suggests that extending life is becoming progressively harder, which supports my conservative prior and pushes against scenarios with extremely high ages.
- **‚Üë Moderate ‚Äî Potential for medical breakthroughs:** This is the most significant factor pushing the forecast upwards. The 75-year timeframe is long enough for potential breakthroughs in areas like senolytics, genetic engineering, or cellular rejuvenation to be developed and applied. This evidence doesn't shift the median of my prior as much as it adds a significant "fat tail" to the right side of the distribution, making previously implausible ages (125+) more conceivable.
- **‚Üë Very Large ‚Äî Metaculus Community Forecast:** The report states a 66% probability that the age will be at least 125 years. This is a very strong piece of evidence from a historically well-calibrated source. It implies that experts and informed amateurs weigh the potential for breakthroughs much more heavily than the historical trend of stagnation. This single piece of evidence suggests my initial prior is far too conservative and requires a substantial upward revision across the entire distribution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Posterior ‚àù Prior √ó Likelihood**
- My initial prior was centered at 119 years. The evidence of slowing gains reinforces this. However, the Metaculus forecast acts as an extremely strong likelihood, heavily favoring higher outcomes.
- **Update Step:** My prior effectively represents a "stagnation" scenario. The Metaculus data suggests a high probability of a "breakthrough" scenario. I can model my posterior as a mixture of these two scenarios. The Metaculus probability (66% for >=125) suggests I should assign a roughly 2/3 weight to the "breakthrough" scenario and 1/3 to "stagnation".
- **Posterior Shift:** This update dramatically shifts the distribution to the right. The median moves from ~119 to a value significantly above 125 to be consistent with the Metaculus data. The new distribution is still right-skewed, but now the bulk of its probability mass is in the mid-to-high 120s. The lower tail is anchored by the "stagnation" scenario (it's unlikely to be below 120), while the upper tail is defined by the "breakthrough" scenario (plausibly into the 130s). To be precise, a 66% chance of being >=125 means the 34th percentile (P34) is 125. My posterior distribution must reflect this.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Is the forecast too high?** I am placing immense weight on the Metaculus forecast, which could be biased by techno-optimism. The strong empirical evidence of slowing longevity gains might be the more reliable guide. A global catastrophe or the failure of geroscience to produce results could easily lead to a future where the oldest person is 121, making my P10 of 120 look like a central estimate. The most plausible alternative forecast is a "stagnation" model, with a median around 120 and a P90 around 124.
- **Is the forecast too low?** A true breakthrough in aging reversal could be more effective than I've modeled. If aging becomes a treatable condition, the maximum age could be far higher, perhaps 140 or 150. In this case, my entire distribution, even the P90 of 136, would be too low.
- **Adjustment:** My process of explicitly using the Metaculus data point (P(Age>=125) = 0.66) to calibrate my posterior distribution is a direct response to the strongest piece of evidence. It forces me to move away from my more conservative intuition. The resulting wide range from P10 to P90 reflects the high uncertainty inherent in forecasting technological breakthroughs. I believe this distribution appropriately balances the competing evidence.
