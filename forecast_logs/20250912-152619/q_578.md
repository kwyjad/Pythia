## Research (summary)

CALIBRATION GUIDANCE (auto-generated weekly):
BINARY CALIBRATION
- No resolved binary questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.
- Advice: keep using base rates + small evidence-weighted updates; avoid big swings.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE CALIBRATION (Top-1)
- No resolved MCQ questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.

NUMERIC CALIBRATION (PIT-lite + CRPS)
- No resolved numeric questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.
- When numeric results exist, we’ll check p10/p50/p90 coverage and CRPS.

General takeaway: apply **small** nudges only where gaps are consistent with decent sample sizes (≥10).

### Reference class & base rates
- **Global Catastrophic Risks (GCRs):** Events affecting large areas with massive death tolls or economic losses. Base rate: Extremely low, but non-zero.
- **Historical extinction events:** Extinction of species over geological time. Base rate: High over millions of years, but low on a century scale.
- **Nuclear war and pandemics:** Historical near-misses and pandemics. Base rate: Low, but significant given technological advancements.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2023-10-01] ↑ — AI advancements raise concerns about existential risks.
- [2022-12-15] ↓ — Global cooperation on climate change shows progress, reducing environmental risk.
- [2024-06-20] ↑ — Geopolitical tensions increase, raising nuclear conflict risk.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Technological advancements (large):** AI and biotechnology could pose existential threats.
- **Geopolitical stability (moderate):** Tensions could lead to nuclear or large-scale conflict.
- **Climate change (moderate):** Environmental degradation could lead to catastrophic outcomes.
- **Pandemics (moderate):** Emerging diseases could have global impacts.
- **Asteroid impacts (small):** Low probability but high impact events.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Technological pace:** Rapid advancements in AI and biotech are unprecedented.
- **Global interconnectedness:** Increases both risk spread and mitigation potential.
- **Awareness and policy:** Growing awareness of existential risks, but policy responses vary.
- **Geopolitical complexity:** Multipolar world increases unpredictability.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Low probability of extinction by 2100, equivalent n = 10.
- **Evidence mapping:**
  - ↑ Technological risks (large)
  - ↑ Geopolitical tensions (moderate)
  - ↓ Climate cooperation (small)
  - ↓ Pandemic preparedness (small)
- **Net effect:** Posterior probability should move slightly up, reflecting increased technological and geopolitical risks.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
  - Escalation in AI capabilities without regulation.
  - Rising geopolitical tensions or conflicts.
  - Breakthroughs in biotechnology with dual-use potential.
- **DOWN indicators:**
  - Strengthened international treaties on nuclear disarmament.
  - Advances in climate change mitigation.
  - Improved global pandemic response frameworks.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Uncertainty in technological impacts:** Hard to predict AI and biotech trajectories.
- **Data gaps:** Limited historical data on existential risks.
- **Deception risks:** Potential for misinformation on risk levels.
- **Regime changes:** Political shifts could alter risk landscapes.
- **Definitional gotchas:** Ambiguities in defining "human" and "extinction."

Final Research Summary: While the base rate for human extinction by 2100 is low, recent technological and geopolitical developments suggest a slight increase in risk. Forecasters should monitor advancements in AI, geopolitical tensions, and international cooperation efforts.
