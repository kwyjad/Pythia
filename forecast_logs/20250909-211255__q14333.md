## MODEL REASONING (RAW)
### OpenRouter-Default [openai/gpt-4o]
```
To forecast the age of the oldest living person in 2100, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from the current age of the oldest living person, Maria Branyas, who is 115 years old. Historically, the maximum verified age is 122 years (Jeanne Calment). The base rate distribution is centered around these ages, with a mean of approximately 115 years and a variance reflecting the rarity of reaching such ages. Given the historical data, a reasonable prior might assume a mean of 115 years with a standard deviation of 5 years, reflecting the extreme rarity and variability of such ages.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation reflects historical patterns where very few individuals reach ages beyond 115 years.
   - Differences: Advances in medical technology and increased focus on longevity research could potentially extend maximum ages, but the slowing gains in life expectancy suggest limited impact.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Slowing life expectancy gains (‚Üì Large): This suggests a lower likelihood of significant increases in maximum age, reducing the probability of ages much higher than 115.
   - Potential medical breakthroughs (‚Üë Moderate): This could increase the likelihood of higher ages, but the uncertainty and unpredictability of breakthroughs temper this effect.
   - Increased focus on longevity research (‚Üë Small): This provides a slight upward pressure on the potential maximum age.
   - Current life expectancy trends (‚Üì Small): These trends suggest limited increases in maximum age, reinforcing the base rate.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered at 115 years, the strong evidence of slowing life expectancy gains shifts the distribution slightly downward. The potential for medical breakthroughs and increased research interest provides some upward pressure, but not enough to offset the downward shift significantly. The posterior distribution might center around 114 years, with a slightly increased variance to account for the uncertainty in potential breakthroughs.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for unexpected breakthroughs. Consideration of tail risks, such as radical life-extension technologies, suggests a need to slightly widen the distribution.
   - Alternative scenario: A breakthrough in anti-aging could lead to a significant increase in maximum age, but this remains speculative. The forecast should account for this by slightly increasing the upper percentiles.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the most likely outcomes while accounting for uncertainty and potential breakthroughs.

P10: 110  
P20: 112  
P40: 114  
P60: 116  
P80: 118  
P90: 120

# Forecasting the Age of the Oldest Living Person in 2100

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the historical record of maximum human lifespan:

- The oldest verified human ever was Jeanne Calment who died at 122 years and 164 days (1997)
- The current oldest living person is Maria Branyas at 115 years old (as of 2023)
- Over the past century, the record for oldest living person has typically ranged between 114-122 years

Based on this historical data, I'll use a prior distribution centered around 122 years (the all-time record) with a standard deviation of approximately 4 years. This reflects that while we've seen someone reach 122, it's extremely rare, and most "oldest living person" records cluster in the 114-119 range.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Biological limits to human aging appear relatively stable despite increases in average life expectancy
- The gap between maximum lifespan and average lifespan has remained large
- Verification systems for extreme age claims continue to improve

**Differences from base case:**
- By 2100 (75 years from now), medical technology will likely be significantly more advanced
- The global population will be larger, increasing the statistical chance of outliers
- Focused research on longevity and aging has increased substantially
- Climate change and environmental factors may introduce new stressors

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for higher values:**
- Increasing global population (more people = more statistical outliers): Moderate upward push (+2-3 years)
- Potential medical breakthroughs in geroscience: Strong potential upward push (+5-10 years)
- Increased focus on longevity research: Moderate upward push (+2-4 years)
- Aging population driving interest in extending lifespan: Small upward push (+1-2 years)

**Evidence for lower values:**
- Slowing life expectancy gains since 1939: Strong downward push (-3-5 years)
- Limited progress in extending maximum lifespan despite medical advances: Strong downward push (-3-5 years)
- Environmental factors and climate change: Small downward push (-1-2 years)
- Current stagnation in developed countries: Moderate downward push (-2-3 years)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 122 years, I'll update based on the evidence:

First update - medical advancement potential:
- Prior: Mean = 122 years
- Evidence: Potential breakthroughs in geroscience (+5-10 years)
- Intermediate posterior: Mean ‚âà 127 years

Second update - slowing life expectancy gains:
- Intermediate prior: Mean ‚âà 127 years
- Evidence: Strong evidence of slowing gains (-3-5 years)
- Updated posterior: Mean ‚âà 124 years

Third update - population effects:
- Intermediate prior: Mean ‚âà 124 years
- Evidence: Larger population increasing statistical outliers (+2-3 years)
- Updated posterior: Mean ‚âà 126 years

Final update - environmental factors:
- Intermediate prior: Mean ‚âà 126 years
- Evidence: Environmental challenges (-1-2 years)
- Final posterior: Mean ‚âà 125 years with wider variance (standard deviation ‚âà 6 years)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for radical breakthroughs in aging research
- The Metaculus community forecast suggests a higher value than my analysis
- Historical precedent may be a poor guide if we're approaching a technological inflection point
- I might be overestimating biological constraints on maximum lifespan

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Radical breakthrough scenario: A major advance in genetic engineering, cellular reprogramming, or other technology dramatically extends maximum lifespan to 140+ years
- Stagnation scenario: No significant advances occur, and maximum lifespan remains capped around 120 years
- Decline scenario: Environmental factors or new diseases reduce maximum lifespan to below current levels

After considering these alternatives, I should widen my distribution to account for greater uncertainty, particularly in the upper tail.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 118
P20: 121
P40: 125
P60: 129
P80: 135
P90: 142

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the historical record of the maximum age of humans over the last few decades. The all-time verified record is Jeanne Calment at 122 years. Since her death in 1997, no one has surpassed 119 years. This suggests a plateau in maximum lifespan. Therefore, a reasonable prior distribution would be centered on the recent status quo, acknowledging that Calment's age is an outlier.

*   **Prior Distribution**: A distribution centered around 118-119 years.
*   **Median (P50)**: 118 years. This reflects the typical age of the oldest person in recent years, below the extreme outlier of Calment.
*   **Spread**: The 80% confidence interval might range from 115 (a low but plausible outcome) to 123 (slightly beating Calment's record). This prior assumes that the future will look much like the recent past.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The forecast period extends to 2100, which is ~75 years from now. This is the primary difference from the base case, which is based on the past 30 years.

*   **Similarities**: The fundamental biological constraints on human aging that created the historical plateau are still in effect.
*   **Differences**:
    *   **Time Horizon**: 75 years is a long period, allowing for significant scientific and medical advancements that were not present in the reference period.
    *   **Population Scale**: The global population, particularly the number of elderly individuals, will be much larger in the latter half of the 21st century. A larger pool of candidates increases the statistical probability of an extreme age outlier, even with no medical breakthroughs.
    *   **Technology**: The potential for breakthroughs in geroscience (e.g., cellular reprogramming, senolytics, gene therapy) is a major factor that did not exist previously.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the report and general knowledge.

*   **Slowing Life Expectancy Gains (‚Üì Large)**: The report emphasizes that gains in *average* life expectancy have slowed. This provides strong evidence against a simple linear extrapolation of 20th-century trends and supports a more conservative forecast. It reinforces the plateau observed in the base rate.
*   **Potential for Medical Breakthroughs (‚Üë Moderate to Large)**: This is the most significant factor pushing the forecast upwards. A 75-year horizon makes it plausible that one or more new therapies could fundamentally alter the aging process for people who will be old in 2100. This evidence strongly suggests the need for a "fat right tail" in the distribution, making ages well above Calment's record (e.g., 125-130) plausible.
*   **Larger Elderly Population (‚Üë Moderate)**: Basic statistics dictate that a larger sample size (more old people) will produce more extreme outliers. This provides a steady upward pressure on the maximum age, independent of specific breakthroughs.
*   **Metaculus Community Forecast (‚Üë Very Large)**: The Metaculus community median for this question is 124. This is a very strong signal from a group of forecasters who are likely weighing the same evidence. It suggests that my initial prior, based purely on the historical plateau, is likely too conservative and underweights the potential for future change.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My process is to start with the conservative, history-based prior and update it with the forward-looking evidence.

*   **Prior**: Median at 118, P90 at 123.
*   **Update 1 (Population Growth & Tech Potential)**: The combination of a larger population and the potential for breakthroughs makes the prior look too pessimistic. These factors shift the entire distribution to the right and significantly fatten the upper tail. An interim median might move to 121, with the P90 moving to 127.
*   **Update 2 (Metaculus Data)**: The Metaculus median of 124 is a powerful anchor. While not adopting it wholesale, I must adjust my forecast significantly towards it. It indicates the market gives substantial weight to breakthroughs. I will update my median to 122, the age of Jeanne Calment. This represents a 50% chance that her long-standing record will be broken by the oldest person alive in 2100.
*   **Posterior Shape**: The final distribution is centered at 122. The downside is constrained by current biology (it's unlikely to be much lower than ~116-117), while the upside is much wider due to technological uncertainty. This results in a right-skewed distribution. The mean of my final distribution is approximately 122.5, which is a reasonable compromise between my initial assessment and the Metaculus consensus.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider reasons my forecast could be wrong.

*   **Over-optimism on Technology**: The forecast heavily relies on future medical breakthroughs. The history of "anti-aging" research is filled with failed promises. If aging is an intractably complex problem, progress could be very slow, and the maximum age might not budge at all. In this scenario, the outcome would be in the lower end of my range (117-120).
*   **Under-optimism / Black Swans**: 75 years is long enough for multiple, synergistic breakthroughs. Perhaps a combination of therapies will emerge that doesn't just add a few years but represents a paradigm shift. This could lead to an outcome well above my P90, such as 135 or even 140.
*   **Global Catastrophic Risk**: My forecast assumes a relatively stable world. A major global conflict, pandemic, or environmental collapse could reverse health gains and lower the probability of anyone reaching extreme old age. This risk tempers the extreme upside of the forecast.

Considering these factors, the wide and skewed distribution seems appropriate. The P10 of 117 accounts for stagnation, while the P90 of 129 accounts for significant, but not paradigm-shattering, breakthroughs. The median at 122 represents a sensible balance point.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 117
P20: 119
P40: 121
P60: 123
P80: 126
P90: 129
