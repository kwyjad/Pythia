```text
1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the age of the oldest living person in 2100 can be informed by historical data on supercentenarians. As of 2023, the oldest verified age is around 122 years (Jeanne Calment). The base rate should reflect the rarity of reaching such ages, with a mean around 115 years and a variance that allows for the possibility of reaching up to 122 years, given historical precedent.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation still reflects the rarity of reaching extreme ages, as seen in the small number of supercentenarians.
   - Differences: Advances in medical technology and increased focus on longevity research could potentially extend the maximum age, but the slowing gains in life expectancy suggest that significant increases are unlikely without major breakthroughs.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Slowing life expectancy gains (‚Üì): This suggests a lower likelihood of significant increases in maximum age, making higher ages less likely.
   - Potential medical breakthroughs (‚Üë): This could increase the likelihood of higher ages, but the uncertainty and unpredictability of breakthroughs temper this effect.
   - Increased focus on longevity research (‚Üë): This provides a small upward push, as it may lead to incremental improvements in lifespan.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Mean of 115 years, with a variance allowing for ages up to 122 years.
   - Evidence: The strong evidence of slowing gains shifts the distribution slightly downward, while potential breakthroughs and research focus provide a small upward adjustment.
   - Posterior: The mean remains close to 115 years, but the distribution is slightly skewed to account for the possibility of breakthroughs, with a slight reduction in the likelihood of reaching 122 years.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for breakthroughs. However, given historical trends and current evidence, the likelihood of significant increases remains low.
   - Tail risks: Consider the possibility of unforeseen breakthroughs or societal changes that could dramatically increase lifespan.
   - Alternative forecast: A more optimistic forecast might place the P90 at 125 years, assuming breakthroughs occur. However, this is less plausible given current evidence.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - The percentiles reflect a cautious approach, acknowledging the potential for breakthroughs but weighted by the current evidence of slowing gains.

# Forecasting the Age of the Oldest Living Person in 2100

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the historical record of maximum human lifespan:

- The oldest verified human ever was Jeanne Calment who died at 122 years and 164 days (1997)
- The current oldest living person is Maria Branyas at 115 years old (2023)
- Over the past century, the record for oldest living person has fluctuated mostly between 110-122 years

The distribution of maximum human lifespan appears to follow a relatively stable pattern despite significant increases in average life expectancy. I'll use a prior centered around 122 years (the historical maximum) with a standard deviation of about 5 years, reflecting the natural variation we've observed.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- Biological limits to human aging appear relatively consistent
- The gap between average life expectancy and maximum lifespan has persisted
- Supercentenarian numbers remain extremely rare despite population growth

**Differences that matter:**
- We have 75+ years until 2100, allowing for potential medical breakthroughs
- Aging research is receiving increased scientific attention and funding
- The global population is larger, increasing the statistical chance of outliers
- Verification methods for extreme age claims have improved

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for higher values:**
- Increasing global population (moderate ‚Üë): More people alive means more statistical chances for extreme outliers
- Potential medical breakthroughs (moderate ‚Üë): 75 years is sufficient time for significant advances in geroscience
- Aging population driving research interest (small ‚Üë): More resources directed at longevity science

**Evidence for lower values:**
- Slowing life expectancy gains since 1939 (large ‚Üì): Suggests diminishing returns in longevity improvements
- Maximum lifespan has remained relatively stable despite medical advances (moderate ‚Üì): Indicates biological limits
- Current verification data shows extremely few people reaching 115+ (small ‚Üì): Base rates remain very low

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 122 years (historical maximum):

**First update - Slowing life expectancy gains:**
This provides strong evidence that we're approaching biological limits. This shifts my distribution downward slightly to a median of ~120 years, as it suggests diminishing returns in extending maximum lifespan.

**Second update - Potential medical breakthroughs:**
Given 75+ years until 2100, there's reasonable probability of significant advances in understanding and treating aging. This widens my distribution and shifts it upward, with a new median around 125 years and increased probability in the upper tail.

**Third update - Statistical population effects:**
With a larger global population, the chance of extreme outliers increases. This primarily affects the upper tail of my distribution, increasing the probability of values in the 130+ range.

After these updates, my posterior distribution has:
- Shifted slightly upward from the historical maximum (122 ‚Üí ~125)
- Widened to account for greater uncertainty over a 75-year timeframe
- Developed a slight positive skew reflecting potential breakthroughs

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for transformative medical breakthroughs in aging science
- I might be overestimating biological limits based on historical data
- The research report is from 2025, so I lack information about developments between 2025-2100

**Alternative forecasts:**
- A more optimistic view might place the median at 140+ years, arguing that we'll see radical life extension technologies
- A more conservative view might keep the median below 120, arguing that biological limits are nearly insurmountable

**Tail risks:**
- Upper tail: Breakthrough technologies allowing for significant life extension (150+ years)
- Lower tail: No significant advances beyond current capabilities (~115-118 years)

After consideration, I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for the long timeframe and uncertainty, while maintaining a realistic view of biological constraints.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 118
P20: 121
P40: 125
P60: 129
P80: 135
P90: 142

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
My prior distribution is based on the historical record of the maximum verified human age over the last few decades. The all-time record is Jeanne Calment at 122 years. More recently, the oldest living person has typically been in the 115-119 year range. This suggests a strong biological constraint or "soft wall" around this age. Therefore, my prior for the age in 2100, assuming no major changes, would be a distribution centered around 117-118 years, with a very low probability of exceeding 122. The spread would be tight, with a 90% chance of the age falling between roughly 115 and 121.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The forecast is for 2100, which is ~75 years in the future. This is the primary difference from the base case.
*   **Similarities**: The fundamental biological processes of aging that limit lifespan today will likely still be the primary constraints.
*   **Differences**:
    *   **Time Horizon**: 75 years is a long period, allowing for significant medical and technological advancements that are not reflected in the historical base rate.
    *   **Population Size**: The global population, particularly the number of elderly individuals, will be larger than at any point in history. A larger sample size increases the chance of producing an extreme outlier, even if the underlying probabilities for an individual remain the same.
    *   **Research Focus**: As the global population ages, there is increasing economic and social incentive to fund and pursue longevity research, potentially accelerating breakthroughs.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their directional impact on my prior.
*   **‚Üì Large ‚Äî Slowing Life Expectancy Gains**: The research report highlights that gains in maximum lifespan have stagnated for over two decades since Jeanne Calment's death. This is strong evidence that we are up against a hard biological limit, pulling the forecast down and suggesting that breaking the current record will be very difficult.
*   **‚Üë Moderate ‚Äî Potential for Medical Breakthroughs**: This is the most significant source of upside uncertainty. Advances in geroscience, such as senolytics, cellular reprogramming, or gene therapies, could potentially shift the maximum lifespan upwards. The 75-year timeframe makes the development and application of such technologies plausible, though not certain. This evidence stretches the right tail of the distribution, making ages above 122 more likely than the base rate would suggest.
*   **‚Üë Small ‚Äî Larger Global Population**: A larger cohort of people reaching old age provides more "rolls of the dice" to produce a longevity record-holder. This provides a small but firm upward pressure on the entire distribution.
*   **‚Üë Small ‚Äî Increased Focus on Longevity Research**: This acts as a catalyst for the "medical breakthroughs" factor, making them more likely to occur.
*   **Metaculus Community Forecast**: The median forecast of 120 from the Metaculus community suggests that other forecasters are weighing the potential for future progress more heavily than the historical stagnation. I take this as a piece of evidence to update my own median upwards from my more conservative prior.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior**: Centered at 117-118, with a P90 around 121.
*   **Update 1 (Stagnation)**: The strong evidence of slowing gains anchors the distribution, making me skeptical of extremely high outcomes and keeping the bulk of the probability mass below ~123.
*   **Update 2 (Breakthroughs & Population)**: The potential for new technology, driven by increased research and applied to a larger population, counteracts the stagnation evidence. This doesn't guarantee a higher maximum age, but it significantly widens the range of plausible outcomes on the high end. It transforms the prior into a right-skewed distribution, where the most likely outcome is a modest increase, but a significant increase is possible.
*   **Posterior Shape**: The final posterior distribution is centered higher than my prior, influenced by the Metaculus data and the long time horizon. I place the median at 120 years. The distribution is skewed to the right: the downside is limited by the apparent biological wall (it's unlikely to be much lower than recent records), while the upside has a long tail due to technological uncertainty.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be wrong in two main ways.
1.  **Overly Optimistic**: I might be overweighting the potential for technological breakthroughs, which often take longer to materialize than expected. The biological limits to aging could be far more robust than my forecast implies. In this world, the "slowing gains" trend continues, and the oldest person in 2100 is likely to be around 118, with even beating Calment's 122 record being a low-probability event. My P10 and P20 values account for this possibility.
2.  **Overly Conservative**: 75 years is a very long time in technological terms. A breakthrough akin to antibiotics or vaccines but for aging could fundamentally change the landscape. If "longevity escape velocity" is achieved for even a few individuals, the oldest person could be 130, 140, or even older. My P90 of 126 is meant to capture a "moderate breakthrough" scenario, but a truly revolutionary one would lead to a much higher number. I believe this is a lower probability "tail risk" but have accounted for it by creating a right-skewed distribution.

My final distribution tries to balance these competing scenarios, with the median reflecting modest progress and the tails reflecting the more extreme possibilities of stagnation or breakthrough.
