To forecast the number of major US labor strikes with generative AI as one of their main reasons starting in 2029, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate**: Historically, the US sees around 20-30 major labor strikes annually. However, strikes specifically citing technology as a primary concern are less frequent, with only a few notable cases in recent years. Given the recent trend of 2-3 major strikes in the entertainment/media sector due to AI, we will use this as our base rate.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance**: Assume a mean of 2.5 strikes with a variance reflecting moderate uncertainty, say 1.0, given the limited historical data on AI-specific strikes.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities**: The entertainment/media sector continues to be a focal point for AI-related labor issues, consistent with past trends.
   - **Differences**: The rapid pace of AI development and its central role in current labor disputes is more pronounced than in previous technological shifts, suggesting a potential increase in strike frequency.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Increased AI adoption in media**: Strongly increases the likelihood of strikes, suggesting a higher outcome is more likely.
   - **Union leadership focus on AI**: Moderately increases the likelihood, as unions are proactively addressing AI threats.
   - **Public concern over AI job impacts**: Slightly increases the likelihood, as public sentiment can bolster union actions.
   - **Potential regulatory interventions**: Slightly decreases the likelihood, as regulations could mitigate strike triggers.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step**: Starting with a prior mean of 2.5 strikes, the strong evidence of increased AI adoption and union focus suggests a moderate upward shift. Assume the likelihood ratios for increased AI adoption and union focus are 1.5 each, leading to a posterior mean of approximately 3.5 strikes.
   - **Variance**: The variance may increase slightly due to the uncertainty in AI adoption rates and regulatory impacts.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of overestimating the impact of AI adoption. Alternative scenarios include successful negotiations preempting strikes or economic improvements reducing labor unrest.
   - **Tail Risks**: Rapid AI advancements or significant economic downturns could lead to more strikes than anticipated.
   - **Alternative Forecast**: A more conservative estimate might suggest only a slight increase to 3 strikes, considering potential regulatory interventions.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the updated posterior distribution, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the increased likelihood of AI-related strikes while accounting for uncertainty and potential tail risks.

# Forecasting Major US Labor Strikes with Generative AI as a Main Reason in 2029

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **Recent AI-related strikes**: From the background, we've seen 3 major strikes with AI as a primary concern from 2023-2025 (Writers Guild, SAG-AFTRA actors, SAG-AFTRA video game performers). This suggests approximately 1-1.5 AI-related strikes per year in recent history.

2. **Major US labor strikes overall**: The research report indicates 20-30 major labor strikes annually in the US historically.

3. **Technology-driven strikes**: The report notes that strikes specifically citing technology as a primary concern are less frequent.

Given these reference classes, I'll establish a prior distribution centered around 2-3 AI-related strikes in 2029, with significant uncertainty. This aligns with the research report's prior suggestion and extrapolates from the recent trend of AI-specific labor actions.

Mean: 2.5 strikes
Variance: Relatively high due to the emerging nature of this phenomenon

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Labor unions continue to be concerned about technological displacement
- The entertainment/media sector remains particularly vulnerable to AI disruption
- The pattern of unions seeking contractual protections against new technologies continues

**Differences from base rate:**
- By 2029, generative AI will be significantly more advanced and widespread than in 2023-2025
- More sectors beyond entertainment may be affected as AI capabilities expand
- Unions will have had several years to develop more sophisticated responses to AI threats
- Some industries may have already established AI-related protections, reducing the need for strikes
- The legal and regulatory landscape for AI will likely be more developed by 2029

These differences suggest both upward pressure (more sectors affected) and downward pressure (established protections) on the strike rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast upward:**
- SAG-AFTRA election highlighting AI concerns indicates ongoing union focus (moderate upward push, ~1.3x)
- OpenAI's film project demonstrates AI's growing role in media production (moderate upward push, ~1.2x)
- Increasing AI adoption in media threatens jobs (strong upward push, ~1.5x)
- Union leadership focusing on AI issues (moderate upward push, ~1.3x)
- Public concern over AI job impacts (small upward push, ~1.1x)

**Evidence pushing forecast downward:**
- Potential regulatory interventions by 2029 could mitigate strike triggers (small downward push, ~0.9x)
- By 2029, many industries may have already negotiated AI protections (moderate downward push, ~0.8x)
- Early AI-related strikes may establish precedents that reduce the need for later strikes (moderate downward push, ~0.8x)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior of 2-3 strikes (mean 2.5), I'll apply the likelihood ratios:

Upward factors: 1.3 √ó 1.2 √ó 1.5 √ó 1.3 √ó 1.1 ‚âà 3.0
Downward factors: 0.9 √ó 0.8 √ó 0.8 ‚âà 0.58

Combined effect: 3.0 √ó 0.58 ‚âà 1.74

Applying this to the prior mean: 2.5 √ó 1.74 ‚âà 4.35

This suggests a posterior distribution centered around 4-5 strikes, with a wider variance than the prior due to the uncertainty in how these factors will interact by 2029.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating how quickly AI will transform industries beyond entertainment
- I might be overestimating union power in 2029, especially if membership continues to decline
- The definition of "major" strikes and what constitutes AI as a "main reason" could affect the count
- Economic conditions in 2029 could significantly impact strike likelihood
- New AI regulations might dramatically change the landscape

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **High scenario (8-10 strikes)**: AI capabilities advance dramatically, disrupting multiple industries simultaneously with minimal regulatory oversight
- **Low scenario (0-1 strikes)**: Comprehensive AI regulations are established, or AI advancement stalls, reducing the need for strikes

**Adjustments needed:**
- I should widen my distribution to account for these uncertainties
- The right tail should be extended to account for the possibility of widespread AI disruption
- The left tail should acknowledge the possibility of effective preemptive solutions

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all factors and red-teaming my analysis, here are my calibrated percentiles:
