To forecast the number of major US labor strikes with generative AI as one of their main reasons starting in 2029, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate**: Historically, the US sees around 20-30 major labor strikes annually. However, strikes specifically citing technology as a primary concern are less frequent. Given the recent trend of 2-3 major strikes in the entertainment/media sector due to AI, we will use this as our base rate for AI-related strikes.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance**: Assume a mean of 2.5 strikes with a variance reflecting moderate uncertainty, say 1.0, given the limited historical data on AI-specific strikes.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities**: The entertainment/media sector continues to be heavily impacted by AI, similar to recent years.
   - **Differences**: The pace of AI development and its centrality in labor disputes is increasing, suggesting a potential increase in strike frequency.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Increased AI Adoption in Media**: This factor significantly increases the likelihood of strikes, perhaps making higher outcomes 2√ó as likely.
   - **Union Leadership Focus on AI**: This moderately increases the likelihood, suggesting a 1.5√ó increase in higher outcomes.
   - **Public Concern Over AI Job Impacts**: This provides a small upward push, perhaps a 1.2√ó increase.
   - **Potential Regulatory Interventions**: This could slightly decrease the likelihood, perhaps a 0.8√ó factor.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior**: Mean = 2.5, Variance = 1.0
   - **Likelihood Adjustments**: 
     - Increased AI adoption: 2√ó
     - Union leadership: 1.5√ó
     - Public concern: 1.2√ó
     - Regulatory interventions: 0.8√ó
   - **Net Effect**: The posterior mean shifts upwards due to the strong evidence of increased AI adoption and union focus, suggesting a new mean around 3.5-4.0 strikes, with increased variance to reflect uncertainty.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of overestimating the impact of AI adoption. Regulatory changes or successful negotiations could mitigate strike numbers.
   - **Alternative Scenarios**: A scenario where AI adoption slows or regulations effectively address concerns could lead to fewer strikes.
   - **Adjustment**: Given these considerations, slightly adjust the forecast to account for potential mitigating factors.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the updated posterior distribution, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the increased likelihood of strikes while accounting for uncertainty and potential mitigating factors.

# Forecasting Major US Labor Strikes with Generative AI as a Main Reason in 2029

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **Recent AI-related strikes**: From the background, we've seen 3 major strikes with AI as a primary concern from 2023-2025 (Writers Guild, SAG-AFTRA actors, and SAG-AFTRA video game performers). This suggests approximately 1-1.5 AI-related strikes per year in recent years.

2. **Major US labor strikes overall**: The research report indicates 20-30 major labor strikes annually in the US historically.

3. **Technology-driven strikes**: The report notes that strikes specifically citing technology as a primary concern are less frequent.

Given these reference classes, I'll establish a prior centered around 2-3 AI-related strikes for 2029, with significant uncertainty. This aligns with the research report's prior suggestion and extrapolates from the recent trend of AI-specific labor actions.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Labor unions continue to exist and use strikes as a negotiation tool
- AI technology continues to develop and impact various industries
- Entertainment/media sectors remain particularly vulnerable to AI disruption

**Differences from base rate:**
- By 2029, AI technology will be significantly more advanced than in 2023-2025
- AI adoption will likely be more widespread across industries beyond entertainment
- Unions will have had several years to develop specific strategies around AI concerns
- Initial AI-related labor agreements will be up for renewal/renegotiation
- The regulatory landscape for AI will likely be more developed

These differences suggest a potential increase in AI-related strikes by 2029, as the technology becomes more pervasive across sectors and initial protections may need strengthening.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting more AI-related strikes:**
- Increasing AI adoption in media (large impact): The research report highlights this as a major driver, suggesting ~2x likelihood of more strikes
- SAG-AFTRA's continued focus on AI concerns (moderate impact): Indicates ongoing union attention to AI issues, suggesting ~1.5x likelihood of more strikes
- OpenAI's film project (moderate impact): Demonstrates AI's growing role in creative industries, suggesting ~1.3x likelihood of more strikes
- Rapid technological change (large impact): The pace of AI development exceeds previous technological shifts, suggesting ~1.8x likelihood of more strikes

**Evidence supporting fewer AI-related strikes:**
- Potential regulatory interventions (small impact): New regulations might mitigate some concerns, suggesting ~0.9x likelihood of fewer strikes
- Initial agreements already in place (moderate impact): Some protections already negotiated may reduce urgency, suggesting ~0.8x likelihood of fewer strikes

**Net likelihood ratio**: The evidence collectively suggests approximately a 1.5-2x shift toward more AI-related strikes compared to the base rate.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior of 2-3 AI-related strikes in 2029, I'll update based on the evidence:

Prior: Mean of 2.5 strikes, with a relatively wide distribution (standard deviation ~1.5)

Likelihood ratio: ~1.75x toward more strikes

Posterior calculation:
- Shifting the mean: 2.5 √ó 1.75 = 4.375
- The uncertainty remains high due to the long time horizon to 2029

This suggests a posterior distribution centered around 4-5 strikes, with a still-wide distribution reflecting the uncertainty of forecasting 4 years into the future.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the persistence of AI as a labor concern. By 2029, unions might have established standard AI protections, reducing the need for strikes.
- I might be underestimating the potential for AI to become normalized in workplaces, with workers adapting rather than resisting.
- The definition of "major" strikes and what constitutes AI as a "main reason" could affect resolution.
- Economic conditions in 2029 could significantly impact strike likelihood independent of AI concerns.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative forecast would be much lower (1-2 strikes) based on the argument that by 2029, most industries will have established AI agreements, reducing the need for strikes. Additionally, workers might focus on other concerns if economic conditions are poor.

Rebuttal: While some industries will establish AI agreements, the technology will continue to evolve, creating new concerns. Additionally, AI will likely spread to new sectors by 2029, creating first-time AI labor disputes in those areas.

**Tail risks:**
- Upper tail: A breakthrough in general AI capabilities could trigger widespread labor concerns across many sectors simultaneously.
- Lower tail: Effective regulation or industry standards could preemptively address AI labor concerns, reducing the need for strikes.

Based on this red-teaming, I'll slightly widen my distribution to account for these uncertainties.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, here is my posterior distribution for the number of major US labor strikes with generative AI as one of their main reasons in 2029:

P10: 1
P20: 2
P40: 3

## Gemini [gemini-2.5-pro]

Answering this question requires forecasting technological adoption, union strategy, and economic conditions four years into the future. I will use a Bayesian approach, starting with a historical base rate and updating it with current trends and causal drivers.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most relevant reference class is the number of major US strikes where generative AI was a primary concern during the initial period of its widespread impact. The background material identifies three such strikes between the start of 2023 and mid-2025 (a 2.5-year period): the 2023 WGA strike, the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, and the 2024-2025 SAG-AFTRA video game strike. This establishes a base rate of approximately 3 strikes / 2.5 years = 1.2 strikes per year.

Given that these are discrete events, a Poisson distribution is a suitable prior. I'll select a prior centered on this historical rate, perhaps slightly higher to account for the novelty of the issue, let's say a Poisson distribution with a rate (Œª) of 1.5. This implies a mean of 1.5 and a median of 1, with a significant probability of 0, 1, 2, or 3 strikes in a given year.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The base case is the 2023-2025 period. The situation in 2029 will be significantly different in several key ways:

*   **Broader AI Adoption**: In 2023-2025, the impact of generative AI was most acutely felt in the media and entertainment industries. By 2029, AI tools will be far more capable and integrated into a much wider range of sectors, including journalism, software development, education, customer service, and administrative work. This dramatically expands the number of unions and workers who will see AI as a direct threat to their job security and working conditions.
*   **Precedent and Strategy**: The 2023 strikes set a powerful precedent. Unions in other sectors will have had over five years to study the WGA and SAG-AFTRA playbooks, develop their own AI-related demands, and prepare their members for potential action. This makes it more likely that AI will be a central point of contention in contract negotiations across the economy.
*   **Technological Maturity**: The pace of AI development is extremely rapid. The AI of 2029 will be vastly more powerful than that of 2024, making the potential for labor displacement more concrete and less hypothetical, thereby increasing the urgency for unions to act.

These differences all strongly suggest that the rate of AI-related strikes in 2029 will be substantially higher than the 2023-2025 base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the evidence from the research report to update my prior distribution.

*   **‚Üë Large ‚Äî AI adoption in media (and beyond)**: This is the most significant factor. The threat is expanding from one sector to many. This evidence makes a much higher number of strikes (e.g., 4-6) significantly more likely than the base rate (1-2). I'd estimate this factor alone increases the expected number of strikes by 3-4x.
*   **‚Üë Moderate ‚Äî Union leadership stance & strategy**: Unions are becoming more proactive. The "first-mover" strikes have happened, and now a wave of "fast followers" is likely as other unions' contracts come up for renewal. This moderately increases the probability that contract disputes will escalate to strikes over AI. This might increase the expected number by 1.5x.
*   **‚Üë Moderate ‚Äî Public sentiment on AI**: Growing public anxiety about AI's impact on jobs creates a favorable environment for unions to strike, as they can expect more public support. This is a moderate upward pressure.
*   **‚Üì Small ‚Äî Legal and policy frameworks**: By 2029, some regulations may be in place. These could provide baseline protections that satisfy some union demands, potentially averting a small number of strikes. This is a minor downward pressure, as comprehensive federal labor legislation is unlikely.

The cumulative effect of this evidence is a strong upward revision of the initial forecast. The expansion of AI's impact across many new sectors is the dominant consideration.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My prior was a Poisson distribution with Œª ‚âà 1.5. The evidence, particularly the cross-sectoral adoption of AI and the strategic learning by unions, compels a significant update to this rate.

A simple multiplicative update:
Initial Rate (Œª) = 1.5
*   Effect of wider adoption (x3.5)
*   Effect of union strategy (x1.5)
*   Effect of public sentiment (x1.2)
*   Effect of regulation (x0.9)

New Rate (Œª) ‚âà 1.5 * 3.5 * 1.5 * 1.2 * 0.9 ‚âà 8.5. This calculation seems too high and mechanistic.

A more conservative, holistic update is to consider that if the number of affected sectors quintuples, but only a fraction of those have the organization and leverage to mount a major strike, the rate might increase from 1.5 to perhaps 4-5. Let's center the posterior distribution around a median of 4 strikes. The distribution should be right-skewed, acknowledging the possibility of a "contagion" effect where multiple industries see strikes in the same year.

My posterior distribution will therefore be centered around 4-5, with very little probability mass on 0 or 1 (consistent with the Metaculus forecast), and a long tail to account for high-impact scenarios.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

I must challenge my own forecast.

*   **Why might I be too high?** The main reason would be successful preemption. The 2023 strikes were a "shot across the bow." Many employers, seeing the disruption, may proactively offer significant AI protections in contracts to avoid strikes. This could lead to many deals being made without work stoppages. My forecast might be underestimating this deterrent effect.
*   **Why might I be too low?** The pace of AI development is a massive uncertainty. A sudden breakthrough in AI capability in 2028 could create an unprecedented crisis across numerous white-collar professions, triggering a wave of strikes far larger than I've anticipated. My forecast assumes a more linear progression of AI adoption and impact. The potential for a correlated, systemic shock across multiple industries at once means the upper tail of my distribution should be quite high.

Considering these points, I will adjust my distribution to have a slightly wider range. I will keep the median around 4-5 but increase the P90 value to account for the "contagion" or "breakthrough" scenario, while ensuring the P10 reflects the possibility of successful preemption in many cases.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final forecast is a distribution centered around 4-5 strikes. The lower percentiles account for the possibility that many disputes are settled without strikes, while the upper percentiles account for the significant tail risk of a widespread, multi-sector wave of labor action driven by rapid AI advancement.
