```text
1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the age of the oldest living person in 2100 can be informed by historical data on supercentenarians. As of 2023, the oldest verified age is around 122 years (Jeanne Calment). The base rate should reflect the rarity of reaching such ages, with a mean around 115 years and a variance that allows for the possibility of reaching up to 122 years, given historical precedent.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation is similar to the historical base case in that reaching ages above 115 remains extremely rare, and the oldest recorded age is 122.
   - Differences: Advances in medical technology and increased focus on longevity research could potentially extend the maximum age, but the slowing gains in life expectancy suggest that significant increases are unlikely without major breakthroughs.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Slowing life expectancy gains (‚Üì): This suggests that the likelihood of reaching significantly higher ages is reduced, as the trend in longevity improvements has decelerated.
   - Potential medical breakthroughs (‚Üë): While uncertain, breakthroughs in geroscience could increase the likelihood of higher ages.
   - Increased focus on longevity research (‚Üë): This could lead to incremental improvements in maximum age, but the impact is likely moderate.
   - Current life expectancy trends (‚Üì): Developed countries show stagnation, reducing the likelihood of significant increases in maximum age.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Mean around 115 years, with a tail extending to 122 years.
   - Evidence suggests a slight downward adjustment due to strong evidence of slowing gains, but potential for breakthroughs provides a counterbalance.
   - Posterior: Mean slightly below 115, with a variance that still allows for ages up to 122, but with reduced probability.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for unexpected breakthroughs in biotechnology.
   - Tail risks: Consider the possibility of a breakthrough that significantly extends lifespan, though this remains speculative.
   - Alternative forecast: A more optimistic scenario could place the mean closer to 118, but this would require substantial evidence of breakthroughs.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Adjusted to account for the balance of evidence and potential tail risks.

# Forecasting the Age of the Oldest Living Person in 2100

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the historical record of maximum human lifespan:

- The oldest verified human ever was Jeanne Calment who died at 122 years, 164 days (1997)
- The current oldest living person is Maria Branyas at 115 years old (as of 2023)
- Over the past century, the record for oldest living person has typically ranged between 114-122 years

I'll use a prior distribution centered around 122 years (the all-time record) with a standard deviation of about 4 years, reflecting the historical variation we've seen in the maximum age record.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Biological limits to human aging appear relatively stable despite increases in average life expectancy
- The gap between maximum lifespan and average lifespan has remained large
- Verified supercentenarians remain extremely rare

**Differences from base case:**
- By 2100, we'll have 75+ more years of medical advancement compared to today
- The global population will be larger, increasing the statistical chance of outliers
- Focused research on longevity and aging has increased significantly
- Potential for breakthrough technologies specifically targeting the aging process

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for higher values:**
- Growing aging population and increased focus on longevity research (moderate upward push)
- Potential for medical breakthroughs in geroscience (strong upward push if realized)
- Genetic factors that predispose some individuals to extreme longevity (moderate upward push)
- Larger global population increases statistical likelihood of outliers (small upward push)

**Evidence for lower values:**
- Studies showing life expectancy gains have slowed significantly since 1939 (strong downward push)
- Most public health improvements already realized in developed countries (moderate downward push)
- No verified person has exceeded Jeanne Calment's record in over 25 years (moderate downward push)
- Environmental factors like pollution and climate change may negatively impact longevity (small downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 122 years, I'll update based on the evidence:

- The slowing of life expectancy gains provides strong evidence (likelihood ratio ~0.7) that we won't see dramatic increases in maximum lifespan
- Potential medical breakthroughs provide moderate evidence (likelihood ratio ~1.3) for possible increases
- The lack of verified supercentenarians exceeding Calment's record provides moderate evidence (likelihood ratio ~0.8) against significant increases

Combining these updates:
0.7 √ó 1.3 √ó 0.8 ‚âà 0.73

This suggests a slight downward adjustment from my prior. The posterior distribution shifts to be centered around 120-121 years, with increased variance due to uncertainty about potential breakthroughs.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for radical life extension technologies
- The research report is from 2025, and by 2100 there could be multiple paradigm shifts in longevity science
- I might be overweighting the historical record and underweighting future possibilities
- The verification challenges for supercentenarians might mean we're missing some true outliers

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Breakthrough scenario: Major advances in genetic engineering, cellular reprogramming, or other technologies could push the maximum age to 150+ years
- Conservative scenario: Biological limits prove extremely difficult to overcome, keeping maximum age around 115-125 years
- Catastrophic scenario: Environmental degradation or global crises reduce maximum lifespan below current records

After considering these alternatives, I should widen my distribution to account for greater uncertainty, particularly in the upper tail.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the maximum verified age of a living person in 2100. A suitable base rate is the historical record of maximum human lifespan. The all-time verified record is Jeanne Calment at 122 years, a record that has stood since 1997. In recent decades, the oldest living person has typically been in the range of 115 to 119 years old. This suggests a "soft wall" or plateau.

My prior distribution is centered on this modern plateau, acknowledging that the 122-year record is an outlier.
- **Prior Median:** 120 years. This is a compromise between the typical maximum (~118) and the all-time record (122), reflecting a slight expectation of progress over 75 years.
- **Prior Spread:** I'll set a P10 of 116 and a P90 of 125. This range captures both the possibility of stagnation (remaining below the current typical maximum) and the possibility of breaking the long-standing record.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The period to 2100 differs from the 20th century in several key ways:
- **Similarities:** The fundamental biology of aging remains the same, and incremental medical progress is likely to continue.
- **Differences (Negative):** The "low-hanging fruit" of public health (sanitation, vaccines) that drove 20th-century life expectancy gains is largely picked. The research report notes that life expectancy gains have slowed significantly, suggesting diminishing returns. New threats like climate change and novel pandemics could also negatively impact longevity.
- **Differences (Positive):** Two major factors push for higher maximum ages. First, the field of geroscience holds the potential for targeted anti-aging breakthroughs (e.g., senolytics, cellular reprogramming), which was not a factor previously. Second, and more importantly, the sheer number of people reaching old age will be vastly larger. The UN projects the number of centenarians to increase more than 40-fold by 2100. From an extreme value statistics perspective, a much larger sample size of elderly people makes it more probable that a new maximum outlier will emerge, even with no change in underlying biology.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence to update my prior.
- **Evidence 1 (Strong Downward): Slowing life expectancy gains.** The research report emphasizes this. This evidence makes my prior's high end (125+) less likely and pulls the median down. It suggests that broad, population-wide trends are not favorable for extending the maximum lifespan.
- **Evidence 2 (Strong Upward): Massive increase in the number of centenarians.** This is a powerful statistical argument. A 40x increase in the sample size (N) from which the maximum is drawn would, by a simple extreme value heuristic (`log(N)`), be expected to increase the maximum by roughly `log(40)` ‚âà 3.7 years. This is a strong upward push on the entire distribution.
- **Evidence 3 (Moderate Upward, fat-tailed): Potential for medical breakthroughs.** The report notes this as a "moderate" driver. This doesn't necessarily shift the median much, as breakthroughs are uncertain, but it significantly fattens the right tail of the distribution. It makes outcomes like 125+ or even 130 more plausible than they would otherwise be.
- **Evidence 4 (Strong Upward): Metaculus community forecast.** The community gives a 66% probability to the age being at least 120. This implies a median forecast of around 121-122. This is a strong signal from a generally well-calibrated group, suggesting that forecasters are weighing the upward pressures (population size, breakthroughs) more heavily than the downward pressure (slowing gains).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Posterior ‚àù Prior √ó Likelihood**
- My prior was centered at 120. The evidence of slowing gains initially pulls this down. However, the statistical argument from the vastly increased population of centenarians is a powerful counter-force. Applying the `log(N)` heuristic to the current maximum of ~118-119 suggests a new expected maximum of 122-123. This aligns remarkably well with the Metaculus data.
- I will update my median significantly upwards from my prior of 120 to **122**. This update is primarily driven by the population size effect, which I now see as the most important single factor, corroborated by the Metaculus signal.
- The potential for breakthroughs will make my distribution's right tail wider, while the possibility of hitting a hard biological limit or a global catastrophe will inform the left tail. The posterior will be centered higher and have a slight positive skew compared to the prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I might be over-relying on the simple `log(N)` heuristic. Human mortality might accelerate so rapidly after 115 (a "hard wall") that even a huge population of centenarians won't produce an older person. In this scenario, my forecast is too high. Conversely, I might be underestimating the chance of a breakthrough. A true "cure for aging" could lead to outcomes of 130 or 140, which are currently in my extreme tail. The Metaculus community could also be overly optimistic about technology.

However, the population size argument is compelling because it requires no new science, only existing demographic trends. It provides a solid anchor. I will slightly temper the tails of my distribution to account for these uncertainties. The low end should reflect the possibility of stagnation near the current record, while the high end should reflect a breakthrough on top of the population effect, but not a paradigm-shifting one. My P10 of 117 reflects stagnation, while my P90 of 126 reflects the population effect plus a modest breakthrough.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final distribution is centered at 122 years. The main driver is the statistical effect of a much larger global population of very old people, with the tails of the distribution accounting for the competing possibilities of biological limits versus medical breakthroughs.
