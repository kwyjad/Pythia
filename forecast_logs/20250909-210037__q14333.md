## MODEL REASONING (RAW)
### OpenRouter-Default [openai/gpt-4o]
```
To forecast the age of the oldest living person in 2100, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The current record for the oldest living person is 122 years (Jeanne Calment). Given the historical data on supercentenarians, the base rate for reaching 120+ years is extremely low. The mean of this distribution is around 115 years, with a high variance due to the rarity and variability of such ages.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation shares the historical trend of rare supercentenarians reaching ages above 115.
   - **Differences:** Advances in medical technology and increased focus on longevity research could potentially extend maximum ages, but the slowing gains in life expectancy suggest limited impact.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Slowing Life Expectancy Gains:** Strong evidence that reduces the likelihood of significant increases in maximum age (downward pressure).
   - **Medical Advancements:** Moderate potential for breakthroughs, providing some upward pressure.
   - **Aging Population and Research Focus:** Small upward pressure due to increased interest and funding in longevity research.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Low probability of reaching 120+ years.
   - **Likelihoods:** Slowing gains (strong downward), medical advancements (moderate upward), research focus (small upward).
   - **Posterior:** The net effect is a slight downward adjustment from the prior, with a mean slightly below 120 years, reflecting the strong evidence of slowing gains.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the unpredictability of breakthroughs and the potential for unforeseen advancements.
   - **Tail Risks:** Acknowledge the possibility of a breakthrough that significantly extends lifespan, though unlikely.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A more optimistic scenario could place the mean around 122 years, but this is less plausible given current evidence.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect a conservative estimate with slight potential for higher ages due to medical advancements.

P10: 115  
P20: 117  
P40: 119  
P60: 121  
P80: 123  
P90: 125

# Forecasting the Age of the Oldest Living Person in 2100

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the historical record of maximum human lifespan:

- The oldest verified human ever was Jeanne Calment who died at 122 years and 164 days (1997)
- The current oldest living person is Maria Branyas at 115 years old (as of 2023)
- Over the past century, the record for oldest living person has typically ranged between 115-122 years

Based on this historical data, I'll use a prior distribution centered around 120 years, with a standard deviation of approximately 5 years. This reflects that while we've seen someone reach 122, most record holders have been in the 115-120 range.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Biological limits to human aging appear relatively stable despite increases in average life expectancy
- The gap between maximum lifespan and average lifespan has remained fairly consistent
- Verification systems for extreme age claims continue to improve

**Differences from base case:**
- By 2100 (75 years from now), medical technology will likely advance significantly
- Aging research is receiving increased funding and scientific attention
- The global population will be much larger, increasing the statistical probability of outliers
- Climate change and environmental factors may introduce new stressors

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for higher values:**
- Larger aging population increases statistical chances of extreme outliers (small upward push)
- Potential breakthroughs in geroscience and anti-aging research (moderate upward push)
- Genetic factors for longevity becoming better understood (small upward push)
- Increased focus on longevity research due to aging demographics (small upward push)

**Evidence for lower values:**
- Studies show life expectancy gains have slowed significantly since 1939 (strong downward push)
- Maximum lifespan has shown remarkable stability despite medical advances (moderate downward push)
- Environmental factors and climate change may negatively impact longevity (small downward push)
- Current life expectancy trends in developed countries show plateauing (moderate downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 120 years (SD = 5):

First update: The evidence of slowing life expectancy gains significantly reduces the likelihood of extreme values. This shifts my distribution downward slightly to a mean of 118 years.

Second update: The potential for medical breakthroughs in the next 75 years increases the right tail of the distribution, adding more probability mass to ages 125+, but doesn't shift the central tendency much.

Third update: The larger future population increases the statistical chance of outliers, which stretches the right tail further but again doesn't significantly move the central tendency.

My posterior distribution now has a mean around 119 years, but with a wider right tail (more positive skew) and slightly larger standard deviation (approximately 7 years) to account for technological uncertainty.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for radical life extension technologies
- I might be overestimating biological limits to human lifespan
- The impact of climate change and environmental degradation could be more severe
- Societal collapse scenarios could dramatically reduce maximum lifespan

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Breakthrough scenario: CRISPR gene editing or similar technologies fundamentally alter human aging, pushing maximum lifespan to 150+ years
- Stagnation scenario: No significant advances occur, and maximum lifespan remains around 115-120 years
- Decline scenario: Environmental factors or global instability reduce maximum lifespan below current levels

After considering these alternatives, I should widen my distribution further to account for greater uncertainty, particularly in the upper tail.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 114
P20: 117
P40: 121
P60: 125
P80: 132
P90: 140

Answering the question "How old will the oldest living person be in 2100?"

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
My prior distribution is based on the historical record of the maximum verified human age. The oldest person ever, Jeanne Calment, lived to 122. In recent decades, the oldest living person has typically been in the 115-119 range. This suggests a strong biological constraint or "wall" around 120 years. Therefore, my prior is a distribution centered near the current maximums, with a strong drop-off after 122.

*   **Median (P50):** 118 years. This is slightly above the recent average for the oldest living person, reflecting a slow upward creep and the long forecast horizon.
*   **Spread:** The distribution is tight and right-skewed. I'd set the 10th percentile (P10) at 114 (a typical supercentenarian age) and the 90th percentile (P90) at 123 (just above Calment's record), acknowledging that even a small improvement on the all-time record would be a significant event.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The 75-year period until 2100 is different from the past in two key ways:

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental biological processes of aging remain the primary limiting factor, just as they have been throughout history.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Technological Acceleration:** Unlike the 20th century, which focused on public health and treating diseases of the young, the 21st century may see targeted "geroscience" breakthroughs (e.g., senolytics, gene therapy) that directly address the aging process. This could fundamentally shift the maximum possible lifespan, a factor not present in the historical base rate.
    2.  **Demographic Scale:** The global population of elderly individuals will be much larger in the coming decades, increasing the statistical pool from which an outlier with extreme longevity might emerge, even without technological intervention.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the report and external sources.

*   **‚Üì Large: Slowing Life Expectancy Gains:** The report emphasizes that gains in *average* life expectancy have slowed significantly. This is strong evidence that the "low-hanging fruit" has been picked and that further gains, including at the maximum limit, are becoming harder to achieve. This pulls the forecast down, reinforcing my conservative prior.
*   **‚Üë Large: Metaculus Community Forecast:** The Metaculus community predicts a median of 128 years, with a 66% probability of the age being 125 or greater. This is a very strong signal from a group of well-informed forecasters who are likely weighing the potential for technological breakthroughs more heavily than I did in my prior. This evidence strongly pulls the forecast upward.
*   **‚Üë Moderate: Potential for Medical Breakthroughs:** The report notes the potential for geroscience to extend lifespan. The 75-year timeline is long enough for such a breakthrough to be developed, tested, and administered to someone who will be alive in 2100. This adds significant upside risk and fattens the right tail of the distribution.
*   **‚Üë Small: Increased Focus on Longevity Research:** An aging global population is driving more funding and research into longevity. This is an indirect factor but makes the "breakthrough" scenario slightly more likely.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My initial prior was conservative, centered at 118. The evidence presents a strong conflict between the historical/demographic data (pulling down) and the forward-looking technological/crowd-sourced data (pulling up).

*   **Posterior ‚àù Prior √ó Likelihood**
*   **Update Step:** I must significantly update my prior in light of the Metaculus data, which I interpret as a strong likelihood function favoring higher ages. I cannot simply dismiss the historical data, however. I will form a posterior that represents a weighted average of my conservative, history-based prior and the optimistic, technology-focused Metaculus forecast.
*   **Posterior Shift:** My median will shift upward significantly from 118 to a point between my prior and the Metaculus median of 128. I will settle on a median of **124 years**. My uncertainty also increases dramatically. The distribution becomes more spread out and strongly right-skewed to account for the small but non-trivial chance of a major breakthrough. The probability of exceeding the current record of 122 is now roughly 60%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My main risk is being anchored too heavily on the past or, conversely, being swept up in technological hype.

*   **Alternative Forecast (Stagnation):** A plausible alternative is that the biological "wall" at 120 is real and no breakthrough can overcome it in the next 75 years. In this case, the oldest person would be around 118-122. My distribution assigns a ~40% probability to this outcome (P40 is 122), which I believe adequately covers this scenario.
*   **Alternative Forecast (Breakthrough):** Another alternative is that a "longevity escape velocity" treatment emerges by 2060. Someone who is 80 then could live to be 140-150 by 2100. My initial P90 of 138 felt too low to account for this tail risk. I will stretch the upper tail of my distribution to better reflect this possibility, increasing the P80 and P90 values. This acknowledges that while a breakthrough is not the most likely outcome, its effect would be dramatic if it occurred.
*   **Final Adjustment:** I will increase the P80/P90 values to create a fatter right tail, reflecting the high-impact, low-probability "breakthrough" scenario.

### 6. Final Percentiles
P10: 116
P20: 118
P40: 122
P60: 126
P80: 134
P90: 142
