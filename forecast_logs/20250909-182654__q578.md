To forecast the probability of human extinction before 2100, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical base rate for human extinction is effectively zero, as there have been no known extinction events in human history. However, expert estimates, albeit with potential selection bias, suggest a 19% chance by 2100. Given the lack of historical precedent, a more conservative prior of 1% is reasonable, reflecting the extremely low frequency of such events historically.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The base case assumes no historical extinction events, which aligns with the current situation.
   - Differences: Recent developments in AI, climate change, and geopolitical tensions introduce new risks not present in historical contexts. These differences suggest a need to adjust the prior probability upwards.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **AI Risk**: AI experts warn of a 20% chance of AI-induced extinction within 30 years. This is a significant increase in risk, suggesting a high likelihood ratio.
   - **Climate Change**: A 70% chance of Gulf Stream collapse by 2035 could lead to severe climate shifts, moderately increasing the likelihood of extinction-level impacts.
   - **Nuclear Conflict**: Increased geopolitical tensions and potential for nuclear war significantly raise the risk, suggesting a high likelihood ratio.
   - **Historical Extinction Events**: The absence of past extinction events provides a small likelihood ratio against extinction.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 1% probability = 0.01 odds.
   - Considering the evidence, particularly the high risks from AI and nuclear conflict, the likelihood ratios for these events are substantial. For simplicity, let's assume a combined likelihood ratio of 5 (a rough estimate considering the evidence).
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds √ó Likelihood ratio = 0.01 √ó 5 = 0.05.
   - Posterior probability = 0.05 / (1 + 0.05) ‚âà 4.76%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence: The forecast might underestimate the potential for mitigating actions, such as international cooperation on AI and nuclear disarmament.
   - Tail risks: Unforeseen technological or natural events could alter the risk landscape.
   - Alternative forecast: A more optimistic view might emphasize the potential for technological solutions to mitigate risks, suggesting a lower probability.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential mitigating factors, the final calibrated probability of human extinction before 2100 is 5%.

Final: 5%

# Will humans go extinct before 2100?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For human extinction by 2100, I need to select an appropriate base rate. There are several reference points to consider:

- Historical data: Humans have existed for roughly 300,000 years with no extinction events, suggesting an extremely low base rate.
- Expert surveys: The Oxford Global Catastrophic Risk Conference yielded a 19% median probability, though this likely suffers from selection bias.
- Prediction markets: Metaculus community forecast is at 1.0%, while Manifold shows 4.5%.

Given these considerations, I'll use a base rate of 2%. This is higher than the historical rate (effectively 0%) but lower than potentially biased expert estimates. It aligns more closely with prediction market estimates, which aggregate diverse perspectives.

Prior probability: P(H) = 2% or 1:49 odds

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Humans have demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability throughout history
- We have survived previous existential threats (Cold War nuclear tensions, pandemics)
- Global cooperation mechanisms exist for addressing shared threats

**Differences from base case:**
- Unprecedented technological capabilities, especially in AI, create novel extinction risks
- Climate change is accelerating at rates not seen in human history
- Modern weapons systems have far greater destructive potential than historical precedents
- Global interconnectedness increases vulnerability to cascading failures
- Multiple existential threats could interact and compound (e.g., climate crisis triggering conflicts)

These differences suggest the need for some upward adjustment from historical base rates, which is already reflected in my 2% prior.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let's evaluate key pieces of evidence:

**Evidence 1: AI experts warning of 20% chance of AI-induced extinction within 30 years**
- P(E|H): If human extinction occurs, the probability of AI experts warning about it beforehand is very high (~0.9)
- P(E|~H): If human extinction doesn't occur, the probability of such warnings is moderate (~0.3) due to expert caution
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.3 = 3.0
- This evidence increases the probability of extinction

**Evidence 2: 70% chance of Gulf Stream collapse by 2035**
- P(E|H): If human extinction occurs, the probability of major climate system collapses is high (~0.8)
- P(E|~H): If human extinction doesn't occur, such climate warnings could still be accurate but not extinction-level (~0.5)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.5 = 1.6
- This moderately increases the probability of extinction

**Evidence 3: Nuclear war risks with massive casualties**
- P(E|H): If human extinction occurs, nuclear conflict is a plausible pathway (~0.7)
- P(E|~H): If human extinction doesn't occur, nuclear tensions may still exist without leading to extinction (~0.4)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.4 = 1.75
- This moderately increases the probability of extinction

**Evidence 4: Historical resilience of humanity**
- P(E|H): If human extinction occurs, the probability of previous resilience is still high (~0.9)
- P(E|~H): If human extinction doesn't occur, the probability of previous resilience is very high (~0.99)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.99 = 0.91
- This slightly decreases the probability of extinction

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 1:49 (2%), I'll update based on the evidence:

Update for AI expert warnings:
- Prior odds: 1:49
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 1:49 √ó 3.0 = 3:49 = 0.061
- Posterior probability: 0.061/(1+0.061) ‚âà 5.8%

Update for Gulf Stream collapse:
- Prior odds: 0.061:1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.6
- Posterior odds: 0.061 √ó 1.6 = 0.098
- Posterior probability: 0.098/(1+0.098) ‚âà 8.9%

Update for nuclear war risks:
- Prior odds: 0.098:1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.75
- Posterior odds: 0.098 √ó 1.75 = 0.171
- Posterior probability: 0.171/(1+0.171) ‚âà 14.6%

Update for historical resilience:
- Prior odds: 0.171:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.91
- Posterior odds: 0.171 √ó 0.91 = 0.156
- Posterior probability: 0.156/(1+0.156) ‚âà 13.5%

After incorporating all evidence, the posterior probability is approximately 13.5%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be overweighting recent alarming news about AI, climate, and nuclear risks
- The evidence pieces aren't fully independent, which could inflate my estimate
- Selection bias in reporting tends to highlight risks over resilience factors

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Technological advances might solve climate issues and reduce conflict incentives
- International cooperation could improve dramatically in response to shared threats
- Human adaptability might be underestimated in my analysis

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic forecast might place the probability at 5%, arguing that:
- Historical resilience is a stronger predictor than current warnings
- Technological solutions will emerge for climate and other threats
- AI risks are overstated by those working in the field

**Rebuttal:**
While optimism is warranted in many contexts, the unprecedented nature of current technological and environmental challenges means historical resilience may be less predictive than usual. Multiple independent existential threats compound risk in ways not seen before.

Given these considerations, I should adjust my estimate downward slightly to account for potential overconfidence in the evidence and the possibility of mitigating factors. A more calibrated estimate would be around 10%.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, evaluating the evidence through Bayesian updating, and applying red team thinking to check for overconfidence, I arrive at a final probability estimate for human extinction before 2100.

Final: 10%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Event:** Human extinction before January 1, 2100 (a ~75-year timeframe from the report's date of 2025).
- **Reference Class Selection:** A purely historical base rate is uninformative. Homo sapiens have existed for ~300,000 years, so the rate of extinction in any given 75-year period is effectively zero. However, the 20th and 21st centuries have introduced unprecedented technological risks (nuclear weapons, AGI) that make the past a poor guide for the future. Expert polls, like the 19% from the 2008 Oxford conference, are likely inflated due to selection bias. Prediction markets like Metaculus (1%) offer a more grounded data point, but represent a posterior belief, not a prior.
- **Chosen Prior:** I will set a prior of 2%. This acknowledges that the risk is non-zero and significantly higher than in any previous century, but it avoids the high estimates from potentially biased expert groups. It serves as a starting point that is skeptical of extreme claims but recognizes the novelty of our situation.
- **Prior Odds:** P(H) = 0.02. Prior Odds = 0.02 / (1 - 0.02) = 0.02 / 0.98 ‚âà 1:49.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Humans as a species are geographically dispersed and have proven resilient to natural disasters, pandemics, and conventional warfare for millennia. This inherent resilience is a strong argument against extinction from anything but the most extreme catastrophes.
- **Differences:** The primary difference is technology. The base case of pre-20th-century history contains no plausible mechanism for self-inflicted global extinction. The current situation includes at least three:
    1.  **Nuclear Weapons:** The capacity for global destruction has existed for ~80 years.
    2.  **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):** A misaligned superintelligence is a novel and highly uncertain risk vector that experts in the field are increasingly concerned about.
    3.  **Engineered Pandemics:** Advances in biotechnology could enable the creation of pathogens far deadlier than any natural disease.
These differences mean the historical base rate of zero is not applicable, justifying the non-zero prior.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence clusters from the report.

-   **Evidence Cluster 1: Alarming Expert Opinion** (Oxford 19% poll, AI experts' 20% warning).
    -   **P(E | H):** If human extinction by 2100 is a real and substantial risk (H), it is highly likely that experts dedicated to studying these risks would be sounding the alarm with high probability estimates.
    -   **P(E | ~H):** If the risk is actually very low (~H), it is still plausible that a self-selected group of experts would have inflated perceptions due to professional focus and cognitive biases (e.g., availability heuristic). However, the increasing consensus among mainstream AI researchers is a stronger signal than a general GCR conference poll.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence strongly favors H. The combined weight of these expert warnings suggests the risk is taken very seriously by those closest to the potential mechanisms. The likelihood ratio is significantly greater than 1. This evidence increases the probability.

-   **Evidence Cluster 2: Systemic Destabilization** (Gulf Stream collapse risk, increased nuclear tensions).
    -   **P(E | H):** If humanity is on a path to extinction (H), it is plausible that this path would be marked by the breakdown of critical natural systems (like climate) and political systems (leading to war). These events are "risk factors for risk factors."
    -   **P(E | ~H):** If humanity survives (~H), it will be because we are resilient enough to manage such crises. A Gulf Stream collapse or heightened tensions are catastrophic, but not necessarily existential.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence moderately favors H. It points to a world with fewer safety margins and a higher chance of cascading failures. The likelihood ratio is greater than 1. This evidence increases the probability.

-   **Evidence Cluster 3: Aggregated Forecasts (Metaculus)** (Metaculus community forecast at 1.0%).
    -   **P(E | H):** If the true risk of extinction were, say, 10% (H), it would be very surprising for the Metaculus community, with its strong track record, to be off by an order of magnitude. P(E | H) is low.
    -   **P(E | ~H):** If the true risk is very low, around 1-2% (~H), it is extremely likely that the Metaculus forecast would converge near this value. P(E | ~H) is high.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** This is a powerful piece of evidence against a high probability of extinction. The likelihood ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H)) is much less than 1. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
-   **Initial State:** Prior odds are 1:49 (2% probability).
-   **Update 1 (Expert Alarms & Systemic Risk):** The evidence from experts and signs of global instability significantly raises the perceived risk. Let's apply a combined likelihood ratio of 5 to represent this strong upward pressure.
    -   New Odds = Prior Odds √ó LR = (1:49) √ó 5 = 5:49.
    -   New Probability = 5 / (5 + 49) = 5 / 54 ‚âà 9.3%.
-   **Update 2 (Metaculus Forecast):** Now, we must account for the strong counter-signal from Metaculus. My 9.3% estimate is now the prior for this update. The Metaculus forecast of 1% is far more likely if the true probability is low than if it is 9.3%. This requires a substantial downward revision. A simple mathematical average is inappropriate, but conceptually, I must pull my estimate much closer to the market consensus. The Manifold market at 4.5% suggests some disagreement with the low Metaculus number, providing a reason not to adopt 1% wholesale.
-   **Posterior:** Balancing the expert warnings (pushing towards 10%+) and the market forecast (pulling towards 1%) leads to a posterior in the low single digits. The expert warnings are recent and specific, especially on AI, and may not be fully priced into the Metaculus forecast, justifying a final number higher than 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
-   **Argument for a lower forecast (<5%):** I might be overweighting alarming headlines and expert opinions, which are prone to bias. The Metaculus community's track record is formidable, and deviating far from its 1% forecast is statistically risky. Furthermore, "extinction" is an extremely high bar; a catastrophe that kills 99.9% of humanity would still resolve as "No".
-   **Argument for a higher forecast (>5%):** I might be underestimating the unprecedented nature of AGI risk and the potential for cascading, interconnected failures (e.g., climate change -> famine -> war -> nuclear exchange). Prediction markets may suffer from a failure of imagination or a psychological unwillingness to price in such a catastrophic event. The recent, specific warnings from top AI labs are perhaps the most important new information in years.
-   **Conclusion:** My forecast attempts to find a middle ground. It respects the Metaculus signal by staying in the low single digits but acknowledges the gravity of the expert warnings by being several times higher. The 4.5% on Manifold suggests this "middle ground" is a reasonable position.

### 6. Final Forecast
My final probability is derived by starting with a conservative 2% prior, updating upwards based on severe and specific warnings from domain experts on AI and climate, and then tempering that conclusion significantly based on the strong contradictory signal from the well-calibrated Metaculus prediction market.

Final: 5%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
For human extinction before 2100, an appropriate base rate must draw from historical data on species survival, expert surveys, and prediction markets, as direct historical extinctions of Homo sapiens are zero. The reference class is existential risks to intelligent species or civilizations, but since humans have persisted for ~300,000 years without extinction, the raw historical base rate is effectively 0% per century. However, this is unhelpfully low for forecasting rare events, so I incorporate expert estimates and market data:

- The 2008 Oxford poll's 19% median is biased toward high-risk views (selection effect noted in the background).
- Prediction markets provide a more neutral aggregate: Metaculus at 1% and Manifold at 4.5% reflect community wisdom with skin-in-the-game (play money).
- Broader expert consensus (e.g., from sources like Toby Ord's "The Precipice") often places existential risk around 1-10% per century, factoring in tail risks like nuclear war or pandemics.

I select a prior of 2% (odds 1:49), balancing the low historical rate with adjusted expert/market signals. This is conservative, avoiding the biased 19% while acknowledging non-zero risks from emerging threats. It's equivalent to a weak prior (n ‚âà 5-10 observations) to allow evidence-based updates without overconfidence.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The base case is historical human survival through millennia, including past existential threats like the Toba supervolcano (~74,000 years ago, which reduced population but didn't cause extinction), pandemics (e.g., Black Death killed ~30-50% of Europe but not globally), and the Cold War nuclear standoff (no extinction despite close calls like the Cuban Missile Crisis).

Similarities: Today's world still has resilient human societies with global cooperation potential (e.g., UN treaties), technological progress for mitigation (e.g., vaccines, early warning systems), and no prior extinction events, suggesting inherent stability.

Differences: The current situation diverges due to novel, accelerating risks absent in history‚Äîrapid AI development (potential for uncontrolled superintelligence), unprecedented climate change velocity (e.g., possible Gulf Stream collapse), and a multipolar geopolitical landscape with more nuclear actors (e.g., tensions in Ukraine, Middle East, or Asia). Global connectivity amplifies pandemics faster than historical outbreaks. These differences matter because they introduce "black swan" scalability: AI could self-improve exponentially, climate tipping points are irreversible on human timescales, and nuclear arsenals are larger/more dispersed than during the Cold War. This warrants an upward adjustment from the base rate, but not drastically, as mitigation efforts (e.g., AI safety research, climate accords) could counteract them.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I evaluate key pieces from the research report, background, and general knowledge. For each, I estimate P(E|H) (likelihood if extinction occurs) vs. P(E|~H) (if not), yielding a qualitative likelihood ratio (LR = P(E|H)/P(E|~H)). LR >1 increases probability; LR <1 decreases it.

- **AI risks (‚Üë large, e.g., 20% chance of AI-induced extinction in 30 years per recent warnings)**: P(E|H) high (~80%, as uncontrolled AI is a plausible extinction mechanism). P(E|~H) moderate (~30%, warnings could be hype or precautionary without doom). LR ‚âà 2.7 (increases probability moderately, as AI hype is common but recent advancements like GPT models make loss-of-control scenarios more credible).
  
- **Climate change (‚Üë moderate, e.g., 70% chance of Gulf Stream collapse by 2035)**: P(E|H) high (~70%, severe shifts could cascade to famine/extinction). P(E|~H) lower (~40%, anomalies happen but societies adapt). LR ‚âà 1.75 (increases probability slightly; climate risks are rising but extinction-level impacts remain speculative, with adaptation possible).

- **Nuclear/geopolitical tensions (‚Üë large, e.g., recent articles on war risks)**: P(E|H) very high (~90%, escalation to nuclear winter is a classic extinction path). P(E|~H) moderate (~50%, tensions fluctuate without war). LR ‚âà 1.8 (increases probability; multipolar world differs from bipolar Cold War stability, but deterrence still holds).

- **Historical lack of extinction (‚Üì small)**: P(E|H) low (~10%, if extinction were imminent, we'd expect precursors). P(E|~H) high (~90%, aligns with survival). LR ‚âà 0.11 (decreases probability strongly, grounding against overreaction to recent news).

- **Pandemics/technological advances (moderate/small per report)**: Net neutral LR ‚âà1 (pandemics could spike but tech mitigates; balanced).

Overall, evidence leans upward (net LR ‚âà 2-3 from positives outweighing the historical anchor), but uncertainties (e.g., AI timelines vary) temper this.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Using Bayes' Rule conceptually: Posterior odds = Prior odds √ó LR.

Start with prior: 2% probability (odds 1:49).

Apply net LR ‚âà2.5 (conservative aggregate: AI/nuclear/climate boosts tempered by history; avoids overcounting correlated risks).

Posterior odds = 1:49 √ó 2.5 = 2.5:49 ‚âà 1:19.6.

Posterior probability = 1 / (1 + 19.6) ‚âà 4.85% (round to 5%).

For an explicit step: Update first on AI/climate/nuclear cluster (LR=3 for combined ‚Üë effects): Odds become 1:49 √ó 3 = 3:49 ‚âà 1:16.3 (prob ‚âà6%). Then down-adjust on history (LR=0.5 for conservatism): Odds 3:49 √ó 0.5 = 1.5:49 ‚âà 1:32.7 (prob ‚âà3%). Net: ~4% posterior.

This remains uncertain (wide credible interval ~1-10%) due to sparse data on tail risks and potential mitigations.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in upward adjustments‚Äîrecent news (e.g., AI warnings) could be availability bias, inflating LR without true novelty (similar hype existed for nukes in the 1950s). Blind spots: Underestimating human resilience (e.g., we've survived ice ages); ignoring positive trends like declining war deaths or AI safety progress (e.g., EU AI Act). Tail risks: Low-probability highs like engineered pandemics (could push to 10%+) or asteroid impacts (rare but unmitigated). Alternative forecast: A skeptic might say 1% (sticking closer to Metaculus, arguing risks are overhyped and mitigations will prevail‚Äîplausible if geopolitics stabilize). Rebuttal: Markets undervalue tails, and recent developments (e.g., Gulf Stream study) are evidence-based shifts. A high-end alternative: 10% (aligning more with biased experts, emphasizing AI acceleration). Rebuttal: Selection bias and lack of historical calibration make this overconfident. To adjust, I widen my implicit distribution: p10=1%, p50=4%, p90=8%, pulling the median down slightly to avoid big swings per calibration advice.

Final adjusted posterior: 3% (small nudge down for overconfidence critique).
