## Research (summary)

CALIBRATION GUIDANCE (auto-generated weekly):
BINARY CALIBRATION
- No resolved binary questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.
- Advice: keep using base rates + small evidence-weighted updates; avoid big swings.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE CALIBRATION (Top-1)
- No resolved MCQ questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.

NUMERIC CALIBRATION (PIT-lite + CRPS)
- No resolved numeric questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.
- When numeric results exist, we’ll check p10/p50/p90 coverage and CRPS.

General takeaway: apply **small** nudges only where gaps are consistent with decent sample sizes (≥10).

### Reference class & base rates
- **Nuclear war**: Historically, no nuclear war has led to human extinction; base rate is effectively 0%.
- **Pandemics**: No pandemic has caused human extinction; base rate is 0%, though severe pandemics have occurred.
- **Asteroid impacts**: Large impacts are rare; estimated extinction-level events occur every 100 million years.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-02-27] ↓ — IDRiM2025 conference emphasizes disaster risk reduction, indicating proactive measures.
- [2025-07-16] ↓ — LIFSC 2.0 conference in Lagos focuses on disaster preparedness, reducing extinction risk.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Nuclear proliferation**: Moderate ↑ — Increases risk of nuclear conflict.
- **Biotechnology advances**: Moderate ↑ — Potential for engineered pandemics.
- **Climate change**: Small ↑ — Long-term environmental stress.
- **Global cooperation**: Moderate ↓ — Reduces risk through collective action.
- **Technological safeguards**: Moderate ↓ — Advances in risk mitigation technologies.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Technological advancement**: Rapid progress in AI and biotech increases both risk and mitigation potential.
- **Global interconnectedness**: Increases risk spread but also enhances cooperative mitigation.
- **Policy focus**: Increased emphasis on global risk reduction compared to historical norms.
- **Public awareness**: Growing awareness of existential risks, potentially leading to more preventive measures.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Low probability of extinction by 2100, equivalent n = 10.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Nuclear proliferation (moderate)
  - ↑ Biotechnology risks (moderate)
  - ↓ Global cooperation (moderate)
  - ↓ Technological safeguards (moderate)
- **Net effect**: Posterior should slightly increase due to technological and geopolitical risks, but mitigated by global cooperation and safeguards.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Increased nuclear tensions.
  - Breakthroughs in biotechnology without regulation.
  - Climate change acceleration.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - New international treaties on risk reduction.
  - Advances in global surveillance for pandemics.
  - Technological breakthroughs in risk mitigation.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Uncertainty in predictions**: Long-term forecasts are inherently uncertain.
- **Data gaps**: Limited historical data on extinction-level events.
- **Deception risks**: Potential for misinformation on global risks.
- **Regime changes**: Political shifts can alter risk landscapes.
- **Definitional gotchas**: Ambiguities in defining "human" and "extinction."

Final Research Summary: While the base rate for human extinction by 2100 is low, recent technological and geopolitical developments suggest a slight increase in risk. However, global cooperation and technological safeguards provide significant mitigation potential.
