```text
To forecast the age of the oldest living person in 2100, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from the current age of the oldest living person, Maria Branyas, who is 115 years old. Historically, the maximum verified age has been around 122 years (Jeanne Calment). Given the rarity of supercentenarians, the base rate for reaching 120+ years is extremely low. The mean of this base rate is around 115 years, with a high variance due to the rarity and variability of such extreme ages.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation reflects historical trends where very few individuals reach ages beyond 115 years.
   - Differences: Advances in medical technology and increased focus on longevity research could potentially extend maximum ages, but the slowing gains in life expectancy suggest limited impact.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Slowing life expectancy gains (‚Üì Large): This suggests a lower likelihood of significant increases in maximum age.
   - Potential medical breakthroughs (‚Üë Moderate): Could increase the likelihood of higher maximum ages.
   - Increased focus on longevity research (‚Üë Small): May slightly increase the likelihood of higher ages.
   - Current life expectancy trends (‚Üì Small): Reinforces the base rate, suggesting limited change.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 115 years, the strong evidence of slowing gains shifts the distribution slightly downward. The potential for breakthroughs and increased research interest provides a moderate upward adjustment, but not enough to offset the downward pressure entirely. The posterior mean might slightly decrease, with a slight increase in variance to account for potential breakthroughs.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for unforeseen breakthroughs in biotechnology.
   - Tail risks: Consider the possibility of a breakthrough that significantly extends human lifespan, though this remains speculative.
   - Alternative forecast: A more optimistic scenario could place the P90 at 125 years, assuming significant medical advancements.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the most likely outcomes, considering both the base rate and the evidence.

P20: 117  
P40: 119

# Forecasting the Age of the Oldest Living Person in 2100

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the historical record of maximum human lifespan:

- The oldest verified human ever was Jeanne Calment who died at 122 years and 164 days (1997)
- The current oldest living person is Maria Branyas at 115 years old (as of 2023)
- Over the past century, the record for oldest living person has typically ranged between 115-122 years

The distribution of this base rate appears to have:
- Mean/median: approximately 117-118 years
- Variance: relatively tight, with most records falling within 5 years of the mean
- Upper bound: 122-123 years based on Jeanne Calment's record

This base rate is appropriate because it represents the empirical maximum of human lifespan under modern conditions, which has been remarkably stable despite significant increases in average life expectancy.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- Biological limits to human aging appear consistent over time
- Maximum lifespan has not increased proportionally with average life expectancy
- The gap between verified supercentenarians and unverified claims suggests natural limits

**Differences that matter:**
- By 2100, we'll have 75+ more years of medical advancement
- Targeted anti-aging research is now a legitimate scientific field
- Genomic medicine and personalized treatments may address specific aging mechanisms
- The population base will be larger, increasing the statistical chance of outliers
- Climate change and environmental factors could negatively impact longevity

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for higher values:**
- Growing aging population increases statistical chances of extreme outliers (small effect, ~1.1√ó likelihood)
- Potential breakthroughs in geroscience specifically targeting aging mechanisms (moderate effect, ~1.5√ó likelihood)
- Genetic factors being better understood and potentially modified (moderate effect, ~1.3√ó likelihood)
- Increased focus on longevity research due to aging demographics (small effect, ~1.1√ó likelihood)

**Evidence for lower values:**
- Studies showing life expectancy gains have slowed significantly since 1939 (strong effect, ~0.7√ó likelihood)
- Most public health improvements already realized in developed countries (small effect, ~0.9√ó likelihood)
- Environmental factors like pollution and climate change may negatively impact longevity (small effect, ~0.95√ó likelihood)
- Historical stability of maximum age despite medical advances (moderate effect, ~0.8√ó likelihood)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 117-118 years with a relatively tight distribution:

First update: Medical advancement potential over 75+ years
- Prior: Mean ~117-118 years
- Likelihood: Moderate positive shift (~1.5√ó) for higher values due to potential breakthroughs
- Posterior: Mean shifts to ~120-121 years, with wider right tail

Second update: Evidence of slowing life expectancy gains
- Prior: Updated mean of ~120-121 years
- Likelihood: Strong negative effect (~0.7√ó) for higher values
- Posterior: Mean shifts back down to ~118-119 years

Third update: Statistical effect of larger population base
- Prior: Mean of ~118-119 years
- Likelihood: Small positive effect (~1.1√ó) for higher values
- Posterior: Mean shifts slightly to ~119-120 years, with slightly wider tails

The overall posterior distribution has:
- Mean: ~119-120 years
- Wider variance than the prior (more uncertainty)
- Slightly right-skewed (potential for breakthroughs creates a longer right tail)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for radical breakthroughs in aging science
- The 75+ year timeframe is substantial for scientific progress
- Historical stability might not predict future trends if we cross certain technological thresholds
- I might be overestimating biological limits that could be overcome

**Alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic view might place the oldest person at 130-140 years by 2100, arguing that:
- CRISPR and gene therapy could fundamentally alter aging processes
- Cellular reprogramming techniques might rejuvenate tissues
- AI-driven drug discovery could find compounds that significantly extend lifespan
- The exponential nature of technological progress means breakthroughs could come faster than expected

**Rebuttal:**
- Despite significant medical advances over the past century, maximum lifespan has remained remarkably stable
- Many proposed anti-aging interventions have failed to translate from animal models to humans
- Biological aging involves multiple complex mechanisms that may resist simple interventions
- Even with breakthroughs, implementation and access would take time

**Adjustment:**
I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for technological uncertainty and extend the right tail to acknowledge the small possibility of transformative breakthroughs.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the age of the oldest living person in 2100. A natural reference class is the historical record of maximum human lifespan. The oldest verified person ever was Jeanne Calment, who died at 122. In recent decades, the title of "oldest living person" has typically been held by individuals aged 115-119. While there has been a long-term trend of increasing maximum age (about 1 year per decade since the 19th century), this trend has shown signs of slowing, and Calment's record has stood for over 25 years.

Based on this, my prior distribution is centered near the recent maximums, acknowledging Calment as a high benchmark. I'll set a prior median at **119 years**, with significant uncertainty. A 50% confidence interval might be [116, 123], reflecting that it's plausible for the maximum age to be lower than recent holders, but also plausible to exceed Calment's record.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The forecast is for ~75 years in the future, which introduces significant differences from the historical base case.

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental biological processes of aging remain the same.
*   **Differences (Shifting the distribution):**
    *   **Slowing Gains (Downward pressure):** The research report highlights that gains in life expectancy are decelerating in developed nations. The "low-hanging fruit" of public health has been picked, and extending life at extreme ages is increasingly difficult. This suggests the historical linear trend in maximum age should not be extrapolated.
    *   **Technological Acceleration (Upward pressure):** The 75-year horizon is long enough for significant breakthroughs in geroscience, biotechnology, or cellular rejuvenation. Such advances could fundamentally alter the upper limits of human lifespan, creating a strong right skew in the distribution.
    *   **Population Size (Upward pressure):** The global population, and particularly the number of elderly people (80+), will be much larger in the coming decades. From extreme value theory, a larger sample size increases the expected value of the maximum. A much larger pool of centenarians and supercentenarians makes a new record age more likely, even without changes in individual mortality rates at those ages.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their directional impact on my prior.

*   **Slowing Life Expectancy Gains (‚Üì Large):** This is strong, observed evidence that pushes the forecast down. It makes ages significantly above 122 less likely than a simple trend extrapolation would suggest.
*   **Potential for Medical Breakthroughs (‚Üë Moderate):** This is the primary source of upside uncertainty. It doesn't raise the median by much (as a breakthrough is not guaranteed), but it significantly "fattens" the right tail of the distribution, making ages like 130+ more plausible than they would be otherwise.
*   **Larger Population Base (‚Üë Small/Moderate):** This is a near-certainty and provides a steady upward pressure on the median and the entire distribution. A larger pool of candidates for "oldest person" mechanically increases the expected maximum age.
*   **Metaculus Community Forecast (‚Üë Large):** The Metaculus community median forecast is 123.5 years, with a 25th-75th percentile range of 120-128. This is a strong signal from a group of informed forecasters who have weighed similar evidence. Their forecast is significantly higher than my prior, suggesting they place more weight on the upward pressures (technology, population) than the downward pressure (slowing gains). This evidence strongly suggests I should update my own median upward.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior Median:** 119 years.
*   **Update 1 (Slowing Gains):** The evidence of slowing gains pulls the median down, perhaps to 118, and tempers expectations for the upper tail.
*   **Update 2 (Population Growth & Technology):** The combined effect of a larger elderly population and the potential for breakthroughs pushes the distribution back up and skews it to the right. The population effect might add 1-2 years to the median, bringing it to ~120. The technology effect primarily adds to the tail risk (e.g., P90).
*   **Update 3 (Metaculus):** The Metaculus median of 123.5 is a powerful piece of evidence. I will treat it as a strong signal and significantly adjust my estimate towards it, a process known as "extremizing" towards an informed consensus. I will not adopt it wholesale, as I remain slightly more skeptical about the timing and impact of breakthroughs on the specific cohort that will be supercentenarians in 2100.

My posterior median will therefore be **122 years**. This represents a 50% probability that Jeanne Calment's record will be broken by 2100. The distribution will be right-skewed, reflecting that the downside is limited (unlikely to be below ~115) while the upside from technology is highly uncertain but potentially large.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My primary risk is being anchored too heavily on the past record of Jeanne Calment (122 years). The Metaculus community is forecasting a median *above* her record, suggesting they believe breaking it is more likely than not. My initial median of 119 was likely too conservative.

*   **Alternative Bullish Scenario:** Breakthroughs in rejuvenation are discovered by 2050 and are widely available (at least to the wealthy) by 2070. The oldest person in 2100, likely born in the 1970s or 1980s, could benefit from these for decades. In this world, an age of 130 or even 135 is plausible. My P90 should reflect this possibility.
*   **Alternative Bearish Scenario:** The biological limits to aging are harder than anticipated (the "Gompertz wall"). Gains continue to stagnate, and environmental or social factors (e.g., new pandemics) put a damper on longevity. In this case, the oldest person might be around 117-119, similar to today's records. My P10 should reflect this.

Considering these scenarios, I will widen the tails of my distribution to better reflect the high uncertainty over a 75-year timeframe. I will increase my P80 and P90 values to give more weight to the high-impact technological possibility, aligning the upper end of my forecast more closely with the Metaculus distribution.
