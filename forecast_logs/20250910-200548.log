## MODEL REASONING (RAW)
### OpenRouter-Default [openai/gpt-4o]
```
1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical base rate for human extinction is extremely low, as there have been no known extinction events for humans. Given the absence of such events, a reasonable prior might be set at a very low probability, such as 0.1% (or odds of 1 in 1,000). This reflects the historical stability of human survival despite various global challenges.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation shares the historical context of no prior human extinction events.
   - Differences: Technological advancements, particularly in AI and biotechnology, and increased geopolitical tensions present new risks that were not as pronounced in the past. These differences suggest a need to adjust the base rate slightly upward.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **AI Advancements**: The rapid development of AI increases existential risk due to potential loss of control. Likelihood ratio > 1, increasing probability.
   - **Geopolitical Tensions**: Rising tensions increase the risk of nuclear conflict. Likelihood ratio > 1, increasing probability.
   - **Climate Cooperation**: Progress in global cooperation on climate change slightly reduces environmental risk. Likelihood ratio < 1, decreasing probability.
   - **No Recent Catastrophic Events**: The absence of recent catastrophic events suggests stability. Likelihood ratio < 1, decreasing probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 1 in 1,000 (0.1% probability).
   - Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratios for AI and geopolitical risks suggest a moderate increase in probability, while climate cooperation and stability suggest a slight decrease.
   - Posterior odds: Adjusting for the evidence, the odds might increase to approximately 1 in 200, reflecting a probability of about 0.5%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could arise from underestimating the impact of technological risks or geopolitical shifts. Tail risks, such as unforeseen technological breakthroughs or geopolitical escalations, could significantly alter the risk landscape.
   - An alternative forecast might argue for a higher probability due to the unprecedented pace of technological change and geopolitical instability. However, historical resilience and recent cooperative efforts in climate change provide counterarguments.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final forecast reflects a slight increase from the historical base rate due to current risks.
   - Final: 0.5%

# Will humans go extinct before 2100?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For human extinction by 2100, I need to establish an appropriate base rate. This is challenging since human extinction has never occurred, but we can consider several reference classes:

- **Historical survival rate**: Humans have existed for roughly 300,000 years without extinction, suggesting an extremely low annual extinction probability.
- **Expert surveys**: The Oxford Global Catastrophic Risk Conference yielded a median estimate of 19%, but this likely suffers from selection bias as noted.
- **Other expert estimates**: The Stern Review on climate change estimated a 0.1% annual extinction risk, which compounds to roughly 7% by 2100.
- **Metaculus community**: Current prediction is around 4.5% according to the market snapshot.

Given these considerations, I'll use a base rate of 5% as my prior probability. This acknowledges both the historical resilience of humanity while accounting for modern existential risks that didn't exist throughout most of human history.

Prior probability P(H) = 5% or 1:19 odds against extinction.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Humans have demonstrated remarkable adaptability throughout history
- Global cooperation mechanisms exist for addressing shared threats
- Technological progress generally improves our ability to detect and respond to threats

**Differences from base case:**
- Unprecedented technological risks (AI, biotechnology) that could pose existential threats
- Climate change and environmental degradation at scales not previously experienced
- Nuclear weapons and other WMDs create persistent extinction risks
- Global interconnectedness increases vulnerability to pandemic spread
- Technological acceleration is happening at a rate far beyond historical precedents

These differences suggest the need for some adjustment to the base rate, particularly due to novel technological risks.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Technological risks, particularly AI**
- P(E|H): If extinction occurs, advanced AI development without adequate safety measures is quite likely to be involved. P(E|H) ≈ 0.4
- P(E|~H): If extinction doesn't occur, we would still expect to see AI development, but with successful safety measures. P(E|~H) ≈ 0.2
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.2 = 2.0
- This evidence increases the probability of extinction.

**Evidence 2: Nuclear weapons and geopolitical tensions**
- P(E|H): If extinction occurs, nuclear conflict is a plausible contributor. P(E|H) ≈ 0.3
- P(E|~H): If extinction doesn't occur, we would still have nuclear weapons but with continued deterrence success. P(E|~H) ≈ 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.25 = 1.2
- This evidence slightly increases the probability of extinction.

**Evidence 3: Pandemic risks**
- P(E|H): If extinction occurs, an engineered or natural pandemic could be responsible. P(E|H) ≈ 0.2
- P(E|~H): If extinction doesn't occur, we would still expect pandemics but with successful containment. P(E|~H) ≈ 0.15
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.15 = 1.33
- This evidence moderately increases the probability of extinction.

**Evidence 4: Historical resilience of humanity**
- P(E|H): If extinction occurs, it would represent an unprecedented failure of human adaptability. P(E|H) ≈ 0.1
- P(E|~H): If extinction doesn't occur, this aligns with humanity's historical track record. P(E|~H) ≈ 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability of extinction.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 1:19 (5%), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on technological risks (AI):**
- Prior odds: 1:19 = 0.053
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 0.053 × 2.0 = 0.106
- Posterior probability: 0.106/(1 + 0.106) ≈ 9.6%

**Update on nuclear weapons and geopolitical tensions:**
- Prior odds: 0.106
- Likelihood ratio: 1.2
- Posterior odds: 0.106 × 1.2 = 0.127
- Posterior probability: 0.127/(1 + 0.127) ≈ 11.3%

**Update on pandemic risks:**
- Prior odds: 0.127
- Likelihood ratio: 1.33
- Posterior odds: 0.127 × 1.33 = 0.169
- Posterior probability: 0.169/(1 + 0.169) ≈ 14.5%

**Update on historical resilience:**
- Prior odds: 0.169
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.169 × 0.11 = 0.019
- Posterior probability: 0.019/(1 + 0.019) ≈ 1.9%

This final posterior probability of 1.9% seems too low given the novel risks humanity faces. I need to reconsider my likelihood ratios, particularly for historical resilience.

Adjusting the historical resilience likelihood ratio to 0.3 (less extreme):
- Posterior odds: 0.169 × 0.3 = 0.051
- Posterior probability: 0.051/(1 + 0.051) ≈ 4.9%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the compounding effects of multiple simultaneous crises
- The likelihood of technological breakthroughs that could either dramatically increase or decrease extinction risk
- Unknown unknowns - extinction risks we haven't yet identified
- The potential for human adaptation and technological solutions to emerging threats

**Alternative forecasts:**
- Higher probability (10-15%): If one weights technological risks more heavily, particularly unaligned AI or engineered pandemics
- Lower probability (<1%): If one believes human adaptability and technological solutions will outpace existential threats

**Rebuttals:**
- Against higher probability: Historical resilience suggests humans are extremely adaptable; extinction would require simultaneous failure of all human populations worldwide
- Against lower probability: Novel technological risks have no historical precedent and could develop faster than our safety measures

After this consideration, I believe my estimate of around 5% is reasonable but should be adjusted slightly upward to account for technological acceleration and compounding risks.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and red team thinking, I arrive at a final probability of 6% for human extinction before 2100. This reflects both the historical resilience of humanity and the novel existential risks we now face, particularly from advanced technologies.

Final: 6%
