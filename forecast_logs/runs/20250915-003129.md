### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical US CPI Changes**: Over the past 20 years, the 12-month percentage change in the US CPI has averaged around 2-3%. However, recent years have seen more volatility.
- **Post-Election Economic Adjustments**: Historically, post-election periods can see policy shifts affecting inflation, with base rates varying widely depending on the administration's policies.
- **Limitations**: Economic conditions and policy impacts can vary significantly, making historical averages less predictive in volatile periods.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-08-19] Inflation ↑ — Recent data shows inflation rising, complicating efforts to stabilize prices.
- [2024-09-17] Inflation ↓ — Inflation hit a three-year low, suggesting potential for continued downward trend.
- [2025-03-04] Policy uncertainty ↑ — Trump's address highlighted potential for aggressive economic policies, increasing uncertainty.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Monetary Policy**: Large — Interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve can significantly impact inflation.
- **Fiscal Policy**: Moderate — Government spending and tax policies can either stimulate or cool the economy.
- **Supply Chain Stability**: Moderate — Disruptions can lead to price increases, affecting inflation.
- **Labor Market Conditions**: Moderate — Tight labor markets can drive wage increases, contributing to inflation.
- **Global Economic Conditions**: Small — International trade and economic health can influence domestic inflation.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Political Influence**: Trump's active role in economic policy is atypical and could lead to unpredictable outcomes.
- **Tariff Policies**: Increased tariffs could drive inflation higher than historical norms.
- **Labor Market Dynamics**: Current labor shortages and rising wages are more pronounced than in past cycles.
- **Fiscal Stimulus**: Recent tax cuts and spending could have a more immediate inflationary impact.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a moderate prior based on historical CPI changes (equivalent n = 20).
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - Inflation ↑ (large) — Recent data suggests rising inflation.
  - Policy uncertainty ↑ (moderate) — Potential for aggressive economic policies.
  - Labor market conditions ↑ (moderate) — Tight labor markets could sustain inflation.
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move slightly down, reflecting increased uncertainty and potential for inflationary pressures.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.
  - Reduction in government spending.
  - Stabilization of global supply chains.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Increased tariffs or trade barriers.
  - Continued labor market tightness.
  - Expansionary fiscal policies.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Data Uncertainty**: Economic data revisions can alter inflation perceptions.
- **Policy Changes**: Sudden shifts in policy could disrupt forecasts.
- **Global Events**: Unforeseen international crises could impact inflation.
- **Measurement Issues**: CPI measurement changes could affect comparability.

Final Research Summary: The probability of a lower CPI change in November 2025 compared to November 2024 is influenced by recent inflation trends, policy uncertainty, and labor market conditions. Watch for policy shifts and economic indicators that could alter this trajectory.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast whether the 12-month percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be lower in November 2025 than in November 2024, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Historical US CPI Changes**: Historically, the US CPI has averaged around 2-3% over the past 20 years, with recent volatility. Given the current context of political and economic uncertainty, a base rate of 50% is reasonable, reflecting the equal likelihood of inflation increasing or decreasing in a volatile environment.
    - **Prior Probability**: 50% (or odds of 1:1).
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarities**: The current situation shares similarities with past periods of economic uncertainty and policy shifts, such as post-election adjustments.
    - **Differences**: The active role of Trump in economic policy, increased tariffs, and labor market dynamics are more pronounced than in typical cycles, suggesting potential for higher inflation.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **Recent Inflation Trends**: Recent data shows rising inflation, suggesting a higher likelihood of continued inflationary pressures.
      - **Likelihood Ratio**: P(E | H) < P(E | ~H), as rising inflation is more consistent with the event not occurring.
    - **Policy Uncertainty**: Trump's potential aggressive economic policies increase uncertainty, which could lead to higher inflation.
      - **Likelihood Ratio**: P(E | H) < P(E | ~H).
    - **Labor Market Conditions**: Tight labor markets and rising wages could sustain inflation.
      - **Likelihood Ratio**: P(E | H) < P(E | ~H).
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    - **Prior Odds**: 1:1
    - **Evidence Impact**: The evidence suggests a higher likelihood of inflationary pressures, decreasing the probability of a lower CPI change.
    - **Posterior Odds Calculation**: Given the likelihood ratios, the posterior odds shift towards the event not occurring.
    - **Posterior Probability**: Adjusting the prior based on the evidence, the probability of the CPI being lower in November 2025 is reduced.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of unexpected deflationary pressures, such as significant policy changes or global economic shifts.
    - **Alternative Scenarios**: A significant economic downturn or successful policy interventions could lead to lower inflation.
    - **Adjustment**: Given these considerations, the probability should be slightly adjusted to account for potential deflationary scenarios.
    
    ### 6. Final Forecast
    - **Final Probability**: Considering the base rate, evidence, and alternative scenarios, the final probability of the CPI being lower in November 2025 than in November 2024 is 40%.
    
    Final: 40%
