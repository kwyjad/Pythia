### Reference class & base rates
- **US Antimicrobial Sales in Livestock (2015-2023):** Sales decreased by 37% from 2015 to 2023, with a 2% decrease from 2022 to 2023. Base rate suggests a declining trend.
- **Global Antibiotic Use in Agriculture:** Many countries show a downward trend, aligning with global efforts to reduce antibiotic resistance. Limitations include regional policy differences and data availability.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2023-12-15] ↓ — FDA report shows a 2% decrease in antimicrobial sales from 2022 to 2023, continuing a downward trend.
- [2023-11-01] ↓ — New FDA guidelines further restrict antibiotic use in livestock, potentially reducing sales.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Regulatory Changes (large):** Stricter FDA regulations can significantly reduce sales.
- **Public Health Campaigns (moderate):** Increased awareness of antibiotic resistance may drive reductions.
- **Market Demand (small):** Consumer preference for antibiotic-free products can influence sales.
- **Technological Advances (moderate):** Improved animal health technologies may reduce reliance on antibiotics.
- **Economic Factors (small):** Economic downturns may reduce livestock production, impacting sales.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Regulatory Environment:** Recent FDA guidelines are stricter than in previous years.
- **Public Awareness:** Heightened awareness of antibiotic resistance compared to past years.
- **Technological Adoption:** Faster adoption of alternatives to antibiotics in livestock.
- **Market Dynamics:** Growing market for antibiotic-free products influencing producer behavior.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Declining trend in antimicrobial sales; equivalent n = moderate.
- **Evidence mapping:**
  - ↓ Regulatory changes (large)
  - ↓ Public health campaigns (moderate)
  - ↓ Technological advances (moderate)
  - ↑ Economic recovery (small)
- **Net effect:** Posterior should move down moderately, given strong regulatory and public health influences.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
  - Economic recovery boosting livestock production.
  - Delays in implementing new regulations.
  - Increased demand for meat products.
- **DOWN indicators:**
  - New FDA reports indicating further sales declines.
  - Adoption of alternative livestock health technologies.
  - Strengthened public health campaigns.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Data Gaps:** Incomplete or delayed sales data can skew analysis.
- **Regime Changes:** Sudden policy shifts may alter trends unexpectedly.
- **Definitional Gotchas:** Changes in what constitutes "medically important" antimicrobials.
- **Deception Risks:** Misreporting or underreporting of sales data by producers.

Final Research Summary: Given the strong regulatory and public health pressures, the likelihood of a ≥0.5% increase in antimicrobial sales for livestock in 2024 is low. Watch for economic and regulatory developments that could shift this outlook.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for this event is derived from the historical trend of antimicrobial sales in livestock. From 2015 to 2023, sales decreased by 37%, with a 2% decrease from 2022 to 2023. This suggests a consistent downward trend. Therefore, the prior probability of an increase in sales is low. I will start with a base rate of 20% for an increase, reflecting the possibility of a reversal in trend but acknowledging the strong historical decline.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The current situation continues to reflect the historical trend of decreasing antimicrobial sales due to regulatory pressures and public health campaigns.
       - Differences: Recent stricter FDA guidelines and heightened public awareness about antibiotic resistance are stronger than in previous years, which could further suppress sales.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - **Regulatory Changes:** The new FDA guidelines are likely to reduce sales. P(E | H) is low, and P(E | ~H) is high, leading to a likelihood ratio < 1, decreasing the probability of an increase.
       - **Public Health Campaigns:** Increased awareness is likely to reduce sales. P(E | H) is low, and P(E | ~H) is high, leading to a likelihood ratio < 1, decreasing the probability.
       - **Technological Advances:** Adoption of alternatives to antibiotics is likely to reduce sales. P(E | H) is low, and P(E | ~H) is high, leading to a likelihood ratio < 1, decreasing the probability.
       - **Economic Recovery:** A potential increase in livestock production could increase sales. P(E | H) is high, and P(E | ~H) is low, leading to a likelihood ratio > 1, slightly increasing the probability.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25
       - Combined likelihood ratio from evidence (considering regulatory, public health, and technological factors as dominant): approximately 0.5
       - Posterior odds = 0.25 × 0.5 = 0.125
       - Posterior probability = 0.125 / (1 + 0.125) ≈ 0.111 or 11.1%
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence could arise from underestimating economic recovery or delays in regulation implementation. However, the strong regulatory and public health evidence suggests these factors are less likely to dominate.
       - An alternative forecast might emphasize economic recovery more, but given the strong regulatory environment, this seems less plausible.
       - Adjusting for potential blind spots, I will slightly increase the probability to account for unforeseen economic impacts.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - Considering all factors, the final probability reflects the strong downward pressures from regulations and public health campaigns, with a slight adjustment for economic uncertainties.
