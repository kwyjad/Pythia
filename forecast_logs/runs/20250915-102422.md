### Reference class & base rates
- **Annual FDA influenza vaccine approvals**: Historically, the FDA has approved seasonal influenza vaccines annually since 1973, suggesting a base rate of nearly 100% for approval.
- **FDA advisory committee meeting cancellations**: Rare, with limited historical data, but cancellations could indicate potential disruptions in the approval process.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-02-26] ↓ — FDA canceled VRBPAC meeting, disrupting typical vaccine approval timeline.
- [2025-01-XX] ↓ — U.S. withdrawal from WHO may affect international collaboration on strain selection.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **FDA procedural consistency**: Typically large positive driver for approval.
- **International collaboration**: Moderate driver; withdrawal from WHO could hinder strain selection.
- **Political influence**: Moderate negative driver; recent policy changes may disrupt processes.
- **Public health priorities**: Moderate driver; focus on other health issues could deprioritize flu vaccine.
- **Manufacturing timelines**: Small driver; delays in strain selection could impact production.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Canceled advisory meeting**: Unprecedented disruption in the typical approval process.
- **U.S. withdrawal from WHO**: Alters international collaboration dynamics.
- **Political climate**: Increased uncertainty due to recent executive orders affecting health policy.
- **Postponed CDC meetings**: Additional delays in the advisory process.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: High likelihood of approval based on historical consistency; equivalent n = 50 years.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↓ Large: Canceled VRBPAC meeting.
  - ↓ Moderate: U.S. withdrawal from WHO.
  - ↓ Moderate: Postponed CDC meeting.
  - ↑ Small: Historical consistency of FDA approvals.
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move down moderately due to significant procedural disruptions.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Rescheduling of VRBPAC meeting.
  - New international collaboration mechanisms.
  - Positive statements from FDA officials.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Continued lack of communication with WHO.
  - Further postponements of related advisory meetings.
  - Negative political developments affecting health policy.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Uncertainty in political influence**: Political decisions can be unpredictable.
- **Data gaps**: Limited historical data on meeting cancellations.
- **Deception risks**: Potential misinformation regarding policy impacts.
- **Regime changes**: Shifts in administration could alter priorities.
- **Definitional gotchas**: Ensure clarity on what constitutes "approval."

Final Research Summary: The likelihood of FDA approval for the 2025-2026 flu vaccine before October 1, 2025, is lower than usual due to significant procedural disruptions, including the cancellation of a key advisory meeting and geopolitical shifts affecting international collaboration.

## Per-model

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The historical base rate for FDA approval of seasonal influenza vaccines is nearly 100%, given the uninterrupted annual approval process since 1973. This suggests a very high prior probability for approval.
       - Initial prior: 99% probability (odds of 99:1).
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The FDA has a long-standing process for approving flu vaccines, which typically follows a consistent timeline.
       - Differences: The cancellation of the VRBPAC meeting and geopolitical shifts, such as the U.S. withdrawal from the WHO, introduce significant uncertainties that are not present in the typical base case.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Canceled VRBPAC meeting: This is a significant disruption, suggesting a lower likelihood of approval. Likelihood ratio < 1.
       - U.S. withdrawal from WHO: This could hinder international collaboration on strain selection, decreasing the likelihood of approval. Likelihood ratio < 1.
       - Postponed CDC meeting: Further delays in the advisory process decrease the likelihood of approval. Likelihood ratio < 1.
       - Historical consistency: The FDA's track record of approvals slightly increases the likelihood of approval. Likelihood ratio > 1.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds = 99:1
       - Considering the significant procedural disruptions, the likelihood ratios for the negative evidence (canceled meeting, WHO withdrawal, postponed CDC meeting) collectively suggest a moderate decrease in probability.
       - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (combined effect of evidence)
       - Assuming a moderate decrease, let's adjust the odds to approximately 80:20, reflecting a significant but not overwhelming shift.
       - Posterior probability = 80 / (80 + 20) = 80%
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The historical consistency might lead to overconfidence in approval despite current disruptions.
       - Tail risks: Consider the possibility of rapid political or procedural changes that could either facilitate or further hinder approval.
       - Alternative forecast: A more pessimistic view might suggest a probability closer to 60% if assuming further negative developments.
       - Rebuttal: The FDA's strong historical track record and potential for procedural adjustments could mitigate some risks.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final forecast reflects a cautious optimism tempered by current disruptions.
    
    Final: 80%
