## Per-model

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for significant labor law changes in Brazil, such as banning a work schedule, can be informed by historical legislative changes. Major labor reforms in Brazil are relatively infrequent and often face significant political and economic hurdles. A reasonable base rate might be around 20%, reflecting the challenges in passing such reforms within a short timeframe.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The current situation involves a proposed amendment with some political support, similar to past labor reforms that have been proposed.
       - Differences: The proposal for a 4x3 schedule is ambitious and represents a significant shift from the current norm, which may face more resistance than typical labor reforms.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - **Evidence 1**: The proposal has been made and has garnered some support.
         - P(E | H): High likelihood if the ban will occur, as proposals are necessary steps.
         - P(E | ~H): Moderate likelihood even if the ban does not occur, as proposals can be made without resulting in change.
         - Likelihood ratio: Slightly greater than 1, increasing probability slightly.
       - **Evidence 2**: Public discourse and media attention on the issue.
         - P(E | H): High likelihood, as public support can drive legislative change.
         - P(E | ~H): Moderate likelihood, as media attention does not always lead to legislative action.
         - Likelihood ratio: Slightly greater than 1, increasing probability slightly.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25
       - Combined likelihood ratio from evidence = 1.2 (assuming slight increase from both pieces of evidence)
       - Posterior odds = 0.25 * 1.2 = 0.3
       - Posterior probability = 0.3 / (1 + 0.3) ≈ 0.23 or 23%
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The base rate might be too low if political dynamics shift significantly.
       - Alternative scenario: A major political shift or economic pressure could increase the likelihood of reform.
       - Rebuttal: Current political and economic conditions do not strongly indicate such a shift.
       - Adjustments: Consider a slight increase to account for potential underestimation of political momentum.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - After considering the evidence and potential alternative scenarios, a slight adjustment upwards is warranted.

    # Will Brazil ban the 6x1 work schedule before 1 January 2026?
    
    ## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    
    To establish a base rate, I need to consider how often major labor law reforms pass in Brazil, particularly those that significantly change work schedules.
    
    Brazil has a history of labor reforms, with the most significant recent one being the 2017 Labor Reform (Law 13,467) which made substantial changes to the labor code but did not eliminate the 6x1 schedule. Major labor law changes that reduce work hours or change fundamental scheduling patterns are relatively rare in most countries.
    
    For labor law reforms that significantly reduce working hours or change fundamental scheduling patterns in democratic countries:
    - They typically take multiple years to pass
    - They often face significant opposition from business interests
    - They usually require strong political consensus
    
    Based on historical patterns of major labor reforms in Brazil and similar countries, I'll set a prior of **20%** that such a significant change would be implemented within approximately a 14-month timeframe (from November 2024 to January 2026).
    
    ## 2. Comparison to Base Case
    
    **Similarities to base case:**
    - This involves a major change to labor laws affecting most workers
    - It would face expected opposition from business interests
    - It requires legislative approval through normal democratic processes
    
    **Differences from base case:**
    - The proposal appears to have gained unusual momentum and public attention
    - It involves a constitutional amendment, which has a higher bar for passage than regular legislation
    - The timeframe is relatively short (about 14 months from now until January 2026)
    - The proposal is more ambitious than typical labor reforms (moving from 6x1 to 4x3)
    
    These differences suggest the probability might be lower than the base rate due to the constitutional amendment hurdle and ambitious nature, but potentially higher due to the apparent momentum.
    
    ## 3. Evidence Evaluation
    
    **Evidence 1: Constitutional amendment proposal with some congressional support**
    - P(E|H): If the ban will happen, we would very likely see proposals like this with some support (0.9)
    - P(E|~H): Even if the ban won't happen, we might still see proposals that ultimately fail (0.4)
    - Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.4 = 2.25
    - This evidence increases the probability moderately
    
    **Evidence 2: Public discussion and momentum**
    - P(E|H): If the ban will happen, we would expect significant public discussion (0.95)
    - P(E|~H): Even if it won't happen, labor issues often generate public discussion (0.6)
    - Likelihood ratio: 0.95/0.6 = 1.58
    - This evidence increases the probability slightly
    
    **Evidence 3: Constitutional amendment process is more difficult**
    - P(E|H): If the ban will happen, it would need to overcome this difficulty (0.7)
    - P(E|~H): If the ban won't happen, the difficulty of constitutional amendments would be a likely reason (0.9)
    - Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.9 = 0.78
    - This evidence decreases the probability
    
    **Evidence 4: Short timeframe until January 2026**
    - P(E|H): If the ban will happen by January 2026, the process would need to move quickly (0.6)
    - P(E|~H): If the ban won't happen by January 2026, the timeframe constraint would be a likely factor (0.85)
    - Likelihood ratio: 0.6/0.85 = 0.71
    - This evidence decreases the probability
    
    ## 4. Bayesian Updating
    
    Starting with prior odds of 20:80 (0.25)
    
    Update with Evidence 1 (proposal with support):
    - Posterior odds = 0.25 × 2.25 = 0.5625
    - Posterior probability = 0.5625/(1 + 0.5625) ≈ 36%
    
    Update with Evidence 2 (public momentum):
    - Posterior odds = 0.5625 × 1.58 = 0.889
    - Posterior probability = 0.889/(1 + 0.889) ≈ 47%
    
    Update with Evidence 3 (constitutional difficulty):
    - Posterior odds = 0.889 × 0.78 = 0.693
    - Posterior probability = 0.693/(1 + 0.693) ≈ 41%
    
    Update with Evidence 4 (short timeframe):
    - Posterior odds = 0.693 × 0.71 = 0.492
    - Posterior probability = 0.492/(1 + 0.492) ≈ 33%
    
    ## 5. Red Team Thinking
    
    **Potential blind spots:**
    - I may be underestimating the political will in Brazil to make this change
    - I don't have current information about the political composition of Brazil's Congress and their stance on labor issues
    - I lack information about President Lula's administration's position on this specific proposal
    - I don't know if there are upcoming elections that might affect the legislative timeline
    
    **Alternative scenarios:**
    - The proposal could be modified to a less ambitious change (e.g., 5x2 instead of 4x3) which might pass more easily
    - Economic conditions might shift, making labor reforms more or less likely
    - A compromise version might pass that doesn't fully ban 6x1 but restricts it significantly
    
    **Best alternative forecast:**
    A more optimistic forecast might put this at 50-60% based on:
    - The apparent momentum in public discourse
    - Potential political benefits for legislators supporting worker-friendly policies
    - The possibility of a compromise version passing
    
    However, this seems overly optimistic given the constitutional hurdles and short timeframe.
    
    Considering these factors, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to 35% to account for the possibility that I'm underestimating the political will or the likelihood of a compromise version.

    Final: 35%

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    Here is a probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    
    *   **Base Rate:** The success rate of proposed constitutional amendments (Propostas de Emenda à Constituição, or PECs) in Brazil within a short timeframe.
    *   **Reasoning:** The primary legislative vehicle mentioned for this change is a PEC. The process for passing a PEC is exceptionally arduous, requiring a 3/5 supermajority in two separate votes in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Historically, hundreds of PECs are proposed each legislative session, but only a small fraction (perhaps 5-10%) ever become law over a full four-year term. The probability of a specific, controversial PEC passing within a single year is much lower.
    *   **Initial Prior:** I will set the prior probability at **5%**. This reflects the inherent difficulty of passing any given PEC, especially on a tight timeline of about a year.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    
    *   **Similarities:** The proposal to ban the 6x1 schedule is a major, structural labor reform with significant economic consequences. Like most such proposals, it faces the high procedural hurdles of the Brazilian legislative process and is expected to encounter fierce opposition from powerful business lobbies.
    *   **Differences:**
        *   **(+) Public Salience:** Unlike a niche proposal, this topic has gained significant public attention and traction through social media campaigns. This popular support exerts pressure on politicians and makes the proposal more prominent than the average PEC.
        *   **(-) Political Sponsorship:** The specific PEC mentioned was proposed by members of PSOL, a small left-wing opposition party. Without the full and active support of the governing coalition and the President's office to negotiate with congressional blocs, a PEC from a small party has almost no chance of success.
        *   **(-) Economic Opposition:** The proposal implies a substantial increase in labor costs for many sectors (retail, services, healthcare), guaranteeing powerful and well-funded opposition from business confederations. This opposition is a formidable barrier.
        *   **(-) Extremely Short Timeline:** The most critical factor is the date. The forecast is being made on September 27, 2025, with a resolution deadline of January 1, 2026. This leaves only about three months, of which only about two are effective legislative months before the December recess. This is an exceptionally short window for any controversial legislation, let alone a constitutional amendment.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    
    1.  **Evidence: Strong public discussion and social media momentum.**
        *   P(E | Ban happens): High. A successful ban would almost certainly be preceded by a major public campaign.
        *   P(E | Ban doesn't happen): Moderate. Many online movements generate discussion but fail to translate into legislative action.
        *   **Likelihood Ratio > 1 (Increases probability):** This moves the issue from an obscure proposal to one with some political energy.
    
    2.  **Evidence: The proposal is a PEC sponsored by a small opposition party.**
        *   P(E | Ban happens): Low. A successful ban would likely require sponsorship or at least co-opting by the government or major party leaders.
        *   P(E | Ban doesn't happen): Very High. The vast majority of bills from small opposition parties fail to advance.
        *   **Likelihood Ratio < 1 (Decreases probability):** This indicates a lack of the broad political coalition needed to pass a PEC.
    
    3.  **Evidence: The deadline is ~3 months away (as of Sept 27, 2025).**
        *   P(E | Ban happens): Extremely Low. It is virtually impossible for a controversial PEC to navigate the entire legislative process (committees and four supermajority votes) in three months.
        *   P(E | Ban doesn't happen): Extremely High. The default outcome for any complex legislation facing a tight deadline is failure due to procedural delays, which are often used as a tactic by opponents.
        *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1 (Strongly decreases probability):** This is the most decisive piece of evidence.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    
    *   **Start with the 5% prior.**
    *   The public salience is a positive factor, which might normally push the probability up to the 10-15% range, assuming a one-year timeline.
    *   However, the combination of weak political sponsorship and powerful opposition would push it back down significantly, likely below the initial 5% prior.
    *   The final and most important update is the timeline. With only three months remaining, the chance of the standard legislative process succeeding is near zero. The process is designed to be slow and deliberative. Opponents would only need to delay proceedings in a single committee to run out the clock.
    *   Therefore, the initial 5% probability must be drastically reduced. A 90% or greater reduction seems appropriate.
        *   Posterior ≈ 5% * (Likelihood Ratio from timeline) ≈ 5% * 0.1 = 0.5%.
    *   This suggests a final probability in the very low single digits.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    
    *   **What is the best argument for "Yes"?** The only plausible path to a "Yes" resolution in this timeframe is not through the standard legislative process. It would require an extraordinary measure. The President could issue a "Medida Provisória" (Provisional Measure), which has the immediate force of law. While highly controversial and subject to congressional approval later, it could technically constitute an "official ban" before the deadline.
    *   **Why is this still unlikely?** Issuing a Medida Provisória on such a contentious economic issue would provoke a massive political battle with the business community and Congress, a fight the government is unlikely to seek just before an election year (2026).
    *   **Alternative paths?** A different, simpler ordinary law could be passed on an emergency basis ("regime de urgência"). This is still a very high bar in 2-3 months and would face immediate legal challenges.
    *   **Conclusion:** The possibility of an extraordinary executive or legislative action is the only thing keeping this probability from being effectively zero. I will assign a small probability to account for this tail risk. A 2% forecast acknowledges this slim possibility while reflecting the overwhelming improbability of success via normal channels.
    
    ### 6. Final Forecast
    
    The combination of an arduous legislative process, powerful economic opposition, and, most importantly, an extremely short remaining timeframe makes the passage of a ban on the 6x1 work schedule highly improbable. The standard legislative path is effectively closed. The only remaining possibility is a low-probability extraordinary political maneuver, such as a presidential Provisional Measure, which itself carries high political risks for the government.

    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    For this question about whether Brazil will ban the 6x1 work schedule (6 days on, 1 off) for most CLT (Consolidation of Labor Laws) occupations before January 1, 2026, I need an appropriate base rate for the likelihood of a proposed constitutional amendment on labor reform passing in Brazil within a limited timeframe. 
    
    Historical data on Brazilian legislation provides a reference class: Brazil's Congress is often gridlocked, with constitutional amendments requiring a three-fifths majority (308/513 in the Chamber of Deputies and 49/81 in the Senate) in two rounds of voting in each house. According to sources like the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies' data, only about 10-20% of proposed bills (including less ambitious ones) become law in a given congressional session (typically 4 years). For constitutional amendments specifically, the success rate is lower, around 5-15%, based on records from 1988-2023, where roughly 100 amendments have passed out of thousands proposed, many taking years. Labor reforms are particularly contentious (e.g., the 2017 reform under President Temer faced massive protests and took months of negotiation despite executive backing). 
    
    Given the ambitious nature here (proposing a shift to 4x3, which implies a significant reduction in weekly hours from the current 44-hour standard), and the initial proposal in November 2024, I'll use a base rate of 15% for such a reform passing within about 13-14 months (from proposal to deadline). This is in odds form: 15:85 or approximately 0.176 odds.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    The base case is similar to past Brazilian labor reforms, like the 2017 outsourcing and flexibility laws, which involved congressional approval amid economic pressures but faced union opposition and took 8-10 months to pass with presidential support. Similarities include: political debate around worker fatigue and rights (as in discussions of overtime caps), involvement of Congress, and public discourse (e.g., media buzz in 2024 links provided).
    
    Differences: This proposal is more radical (mandating 4x3 could halve workdays for some, disrupting industries like retail and services that rely on 6x1), lacks strong executive backing (no mention of President Lula's direct support, unlike 2017), and is a constitutional amendment (harder than regular laws). The timeframe is now compressed—today is September 27, 2025, leaving only ~3 months until January 1, 2026. The proposal is ~10 months old with no reported progress, unlike faster-moving reforms. These differences suggest lower odds: radical changes often stall in Brazil's fragmented Congress (513 deputies, diverse parties), and short timelines amplify inertia.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    Key evidence from background and report:
    - **Proposal existence and initial support (November 2024)**: Two congress members proposed it, with "some support" and media talk. P(E | H) ~80% (if it passes, early buzz is expected). P(E | ~H) ~40% (many failed proposals get initial attention). Likelihood ratio: 80/40 = 2 (mildly increases probability).
    - **Ambitious scope (4x3 mandate)**: This is a big shift, potentially facing business opposition. P(E | H) ~60% (passage might require starting ambitious to negotiate down). P(E | ~H) ~90% (most failed labor bills are overly ambitious). Likelihood ratio: 60/90 ≈ 0.67 (decreases probability).
    - **No recent sources or updates (as of September 2025)**: The research report finds no recent external sources, implying no momentum after 10 months. P(E | H) ~20% (if passage were imminent in 3 months, we'd expect updates like committee votes). P(E | ~H) ~70% (stalled proposals often fade from news). Likelihood ratio: 20/70 ≈ 0.29 (strongly decreases probability).
    - **General context**: Brazil's economy (post-COVID recovery, inflation) might prioritize stability over radical labor cuts, but worker rights are a Lula priority. P(E | H) ~50%, P(E | ~H) ~60%. Likelihood ratio: 50/60 ≈ 0.83 (slightly decreases).
    
    Overall, evidence leans negative due to silence and time constraints.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    Starting with prior odds: 0.176 (15%).
    
    Apply combined likelihood ratio (product of above: 2 * 0.67 * 0.29 * 0.83 ≈ 0.32).
    
    Posterior odds = 0.176 * 0.32 ≈ 0.056.
    
    Posterior probability = 0.056 / (1 + 0.056) ≈ 5%.
    
    This remains uncertain due to potential last-minute pushes (e.g., if Lula endorses), but confidence is low given the silence—I'm ~70% confident in this range, with room for upside if hidden momentum exists.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    My forecast might be overconfident in the downward update; the lack of sources could be due to search limitations rather than true stagnation (e.g., Portuguese media might have unreported committee progress). Tail risks: Upside (10% chance of sudden passage if economic downturn boosts populist support, as in past reforms); downside (near-0% if Congress adjourns early). Alternative forecast: 20% (if basing more on initial buzz, assuming Brazil's left-leaning government favors it)—plausible if I underweighted Lula's influence, but rebutted by the 10-month silence and short timeline, as most amendments take 1-2 years. I adjust slightly upward to account for unknown momentum, but not much given evidence gaps.
    
    Final: 7%
