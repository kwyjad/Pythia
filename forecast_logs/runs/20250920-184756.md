## Research (summary)

CALIBRATION GUIDANCE (auto-generated weekly):
BINARY CALIBRATION
- No resolved binary questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.
- Advice: keep using base rates + small evidence-weighted updates; avoid big swings.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE CALIBRATION (Top-1)
- No resolved MCQ questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.

NUMERIC CALIBRATION (PIT-lite + CRPS)
- No resolved numeric questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.
- When numeric results exist, we’ll check p10/p50/p90 coverage and CRPS.

General takeaway: apply **small** nudges only where gaps are consistent with decent sample sizes (≥10).

### Reference class & base rates
- **Active Volcanoes**: Typically, 40-50 volcanoes are erupting at any given time, based on Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program data.
- **Historical Eruption Rates**: Over the past few decades, the number of active eruptions has remained relatively stable within this range.
- **Limitations**: Data may not capture all eruptions, especially in remote areas, and the definition of "erupting" (activity within 3 months) may vary in interpretation.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-08-15] ↑ — Increased seismic activity in the Pacific Ring of Fire suggests potential for more eruptions.
- [2025-07-30] ↓ — Decrease in volcanic activity reported in the Mediterranean region, reducing the number of active eruptions.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Tectonic Activity**: Large driver; shifts in tectonic plates can trigger eruptions.
- **Seismic Activity**: Moderate driver; increased earthquakes often precede eruptions.
- **Magma Supply**: Moderate driver; availability of magma influences eruption likelihood.
- **Climate Change**: Small driver; may affect volcanic activity indirectly through glacial melting.
- **Monitoring Technology**: Small driver; improved detection may increase reported eruptions.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Increased Monitoring**: Advances in technology may lead to higher detection rates.
- **Climate Variability**: Unusual weather patterns could influence volcanic activity.
- **Geopolitical Focus**: More attention on volcanic regions due to recent natural disasters.
- **Public Awareness**: Heightened awareness may affect reporting and perception of activity.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a prior of 45 erupting volcanoes with an equivalent n of 30 based on historical stability.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Moderate: Increased seismic activity in key regions.
  - ↓ Small: Decreased activity in some regions.
  - ↑ Small: Improved monitoring technology.
- **Net effect**: Posterior should slightly increase due to heightened seismic activity and better detection.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Increased seismic activity in volcanic regions.
  - Reports of new volcanic unrest or eruptions.
  - Advances in monitoring technology.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Stabilization of seismic activity.
  - Reports of decreased volcanic activity.
  - Reduction in magma supply indicators.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Data Gaps**: Remote areas may have underreported activity.
- **Definitional Variability**: "Erupting" may be inconsistently applied.
- **Technological Bias**: Improved detection may skew perceived activity.
- **Regime Changes**: Sudden tectonic shifts could alter forecasts.

Final Research Summary: The number of erupting volcanoes by the end of 2025 is likely to be slightly higher than the historical average due to increased seismic activity and improved monitoring, though uncertainties remain due to definitional and data collection challenges.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for the number of erupting volcanoes is typically between 40-50, based on historical data from the Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program. This range is chosen due to its stability over the past few decades.
       - Mean/median: 45 volcanoes; variance: moderate, reflecting natural fluctuations in volcanic activity.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The current situation aligns with historical patterns in terms of the number of active volcanoes.
       - Differences: Increased seismic activity in the Pacific Ring of Fire and improved monitoring technology suggest a potential increase in detected eruptions.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Increased seismic activity in the Pacific Ring of Fire makes higher numbers of eruptions more likely (2×).
       - Decreased activity in the Mediterranean region slightly reduces the likelihood of higher numbers (0.8×).
       - Improved monitoring technology increases the likelihood of detecting more eruptions (1.2×).
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - Prior: 45 volcanoes.
       - Likelihood: Increased seismic activity (2×), decreased activity in some regions (0.8×), improved monitoring (1.2×).
       - Posterior: The net effect is a slight increase in the expected number of erupting volcanoes, shifting the mean to around 47, with a slightly increased variance due to the mixed signals.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the impact of sudden tectonic shifts or overestimate the effect of monitoring improvements.
       - Tail risks: Consider the possibility of a major tectonic event increasing the number of eruptions significantly.
       - Alternative forecast: A scenario with stable tectonic activity and no significant technological improvements could result in a lower number of eruptions.
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Adjusted for potential overconfidence and tail risks, the percentiles are:
    P10: 42
    P20: 44
    P40: 46
    P60: 48
    P80: 50
    P90: 52
