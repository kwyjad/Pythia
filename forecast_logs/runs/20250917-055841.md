### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical Deportation Rates**: Average annual deportations under Trump (375,000) and Obama (375,000) administrations. Limitations: Policy changes and external factors can significantly alter these rates.
- **Recent Trends**: FY 2024 saw 271,484 deportations, a 43% increase from FY 2023. Limitations: Recent increases may not sustain due to resource constraints or policy shifts.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2024-11-19] ↑ — Trump's campaign promises mass deportations, potentially increasing deportation efforts.
- [2024-12-05] ↓ — Experts highlight resource constraints for mass deportations, suggesting logistical challenges.
- [2025-06-17] ↓ — Reports of high costs and political pushback against large-scale deportations.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Political Will**: Large — Presidential directives can significantly influence deportation numbers.
- **Resource Allocation**: Moderate — Funding and staffing levels at ICE impact operational capacity.
- **Legal Challenges**: Moderate — Court rulings can restrict or enable deportation practices.
- **Public Opinion**: Small — Shifts in public sentiment can indirectly affect policy decisions.
- **International Relations**: Small — Cooperation with other countries affects deportation logistics.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Election Year Dynamics**: Increased political focus on immigration may drive policy changes.
- **Resource Constraints**: Current ICE capacity may not support doubling deportations without significant investment.
- **Public and Political Pushback**: Heightened scrutiny and opposition could limit aggressive deportation policies.
- **Technological Advancements**: Improved tracking and data systems may enhance deportation efficiency.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a moderate increase in deportations, equivalent to n=3 years of historical data.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Political promises of mass deportations (large).
  - ↓ Resource and logistical constraints (moderate).
  - ↓ Legal and political opposition (moderate).
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move slightly down due to significant logistical and political barriers.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Increased ICE budget allocations.
  - New executive orders targeting deportations.
  - Reports of expanded ICE operations.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Legal injunctions against deportation policies.
  - Reports of ICE resource shortages.
  - Public protests or political opposition.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Data Gaps**: Incomplete or delayed reporting from ICE can obscure true deportation numbers.
- **Deception Risks**: Political narratives may exaggerate or downplay deportation efforts.
- **Regime Changes**: Shifts in administration priorities can rapidly alter deportation policies.
- **Definitional Gotchas**: Changes in what counts as a "deportation" can affect reported numbers.

Final Research Summary: While political promises suggest a potential increase in deportations, significant logistical, legal, and political barriers make it unlikely that deportations will double in FY 2025 compared to FY 2024.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the probability of at least twice as many deportations by U.S. ICE in Fiscal Year 2025 compared with Fiscal Year 2024, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Historical Deportation Rates**: The average annual deportations under Trump and Obama administrations were around 375,000. However, the recent trend shows 271,484 deportations in FY 2024, which is a 43% increase from FY 2023. Doubling the FY 2024 deportations would mean reaching approximately 542,968 deportations in FY 2025.
    - **Base Rate Selection**: Given the historical context and recent trends, a reasonable base rate for doubling deportations is low. Historically, such a large increase is unprecedented without significant policy changes and resource allocation. Thus, I will start with a base rate of 10%.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarities**: The political environment under Trump suggests a focus on increasing deportations, similar to past Republican administrations.
    - **Differences**: The logistical and resource constraints, along with legal and political opposition, are more pronounced now than in previous years. These factors make it less likely to achieve a doubling of deportations.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **Political Promises**: Trump's campaign promises mass deportations, which could increase efforts. However, similar promises in the past did not result in doubling deportations. Likelihood ratio: Slightly increases probability.
    - **Resource Constraints**: Experts highlight significant logistical challenges and resource constraints, making it difficult to double deportations. Likelihood ratio: Decreases probability.
    - **Legal and Political Opposition**: Reports of high costs and political pushback suggest barriers to achieving such a large increase. Likelihood ratio: Decreases probability.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    - **Prior Odds**: 10% probability translates to odds of 0.1.
    - **Likelihood Ratios**: Considering the evidence, the net effect is a decrease in probability due to significant logistical and political barriers.
    - **Posterior Odds**: Adjusting for the evidence, the posterior odds decrease slightly.
    - **Posterior Probability**: The updated probability remains low, around 5%.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: The forecast might underestimate the potential for rapid policy changes or unexpected resource allocations.
    - **Alternative Scenarios**: A significant increase in ICE budget or a major policy shift could alter the forecast. However, these remain speculative without current evidence.
    - **Rebuttals**: While political promises are strong, historical evidence suggests logistical and legal barriers are substantial.
    
    ### 6. Final Forecast
    - **Final Probability**: Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the probability of at least twice as many deportations in FY 2025 compared to FY 2024 is low.
    
    Final: 5%
