### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Rarity and desirability** (large): Rare cards featuring popular characters drive higher prices.
- **Market demand** (moderate): Increased interest in Pokémon TCG boosts prices.
- **Speculation and investment** (moderate): Collectors buying for investment can inflate prices.
- **Economic conditions** (small): General economic health can affect discretionary spending on collectibles.
- **Supply constraints** (moderate): Limited print runs increase scarcity and value.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Increased collector base**: Post-pandemic growth in collectors may push prices higher than historical averages.
- **Speculative buying**: More investors treating cards as assets could lead to price spikes.
- **Character popularity**: If the set includes particularly iconic characters, prices could exceed typical ranges.
- **Economic uncertainty**: Current economic conditions might dampen discretionary spending.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Base rate of $349-$433 with moderate strength (equivalent n = 10).
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ New set release (moderate)
  - ↑ Continued TCG popularity (moderate)
  - ↑ Speculative buying (small)
  - ↓ Economic uncertainty (small)
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move slightly up, suggesting a higher price than the base rate range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - High initial sales of Mega Evolution set.
  - Increased media coverage of Pokémon TCG.
  - Reports of high-value sales on secondary markets.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Economic downturns affecting discretionary spending.
  - Reports of overproduction or reprints.
  - Decline in Pokémon TCG interest or media coverage.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Market volatility**: Prices can fluctuate significantly based on collector sentiment.
- **Data gaps**: Limited data on initial sales and secondary market trends.
- **Deception risks**: Potential for market manipulation or counterfeit cards.
- **Regime changes**: Changes in Pokémon TCG policies or print strategies could impact prices.

Final Research Summary: The most expensive card from the Mega Evolution expansion is likely to exceed the base rate range of $349-$433, driven by increased demand and speculative buying, but economic conditions could temper this effect.

- **OpenRouter-Default** ok=True time=13783ms cost=$12.1075 parsed={'P10': 1.0, 'P50': 5.0, 'P90': 5.0}

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - **Reference Distribution**: For the biweekly stock price return difference between Nvidia and Apple, a reasonable base rate is the historical biweekly return difference for large-cap tech stocks. Historically, these differences have ranged from -5% to +5%, with a mean around 0% and a standard deviation of approximately 2%.
       - **Justification**: Nvidia and Apple are both large-cap tech stocks with high volatility. The base rate reflects typical fluctuations in the tech sector, accounting for both companies' market cap and historical performance.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**

       - **Differences**: Nvidia is currently facing regulatory issues, which could negatively impact its stock. Meanwhile, Apple has launched new products, potentially boosting its stock. These factors suggest a deviation from the base rate, with a potential shift towards Apple outperforming Nvidia.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - **Nvidia's Regulatory Probe**: This is a negative factor for Nvidia, making lower returns more likely. Likelihood ratio: 1.5× more likely for Nvidia to underperform.
       - **Apple's Product Launch**: This is a positive factor for Apple, making higher returns more likely. Likelihood ratio: 2× more likely for Apple to outperform.
       - **Nasdaq Climb**: This generally supports tech stocks, slightly favoring higher returns for both. Likelihood ratio: 1.2× more likely for both to perform well.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - **Prior**: Mean = 0%, SD = 2%.
       - **Evidence Impact**: 
         - Nvidia's probe shifts the mean down by 0.5%.
         - Apple's launch shifts the mean up by 1%.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To produce a probabilistic forecast for the excess returns of Nasdaq-100 Futures over S&P 500 Futures for the period from September 29 to October 10, 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Base Rate**: Historically, the Nasdaq-100 has outperformed the S&P 500 by 2-4 percentage points annually in tech-driven bull markets. Given the biweekly period, we will scale this to a base rate of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points (pp) for a two-week period.
    - **Reasoning**: This base rate reflects the historical tendency of the Nasdaq-100 to outperform during periods of tech sector strength, which is relevant given the current tech momentum.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarities**: The current tech sector momentum, as indicated by the Nasdaq hitting record highs, aligns with historical periods where the Nasdaq-100 outperformed.
    - **Differences**: The expected Fed rate cut could boost the broader market, potentially narrowing the performance gap between the Nasdaq-100 and the S&P 500.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **Nasdaq Record Close**: Increases the likelihood of Nasdaq-100 outperformance (moderate impact).
    - **Fed Rate Cut Expectation**: Decreases the likelihood of Nasdaq-100 outperformance by boosting the S&P 500 (moderate impact).
    - **Economic Uncertainty**: Slightly decreases the likelihood of Nasdaq-100 outperformance due to potential defensive sector strength in the S&P 500 (small impact).
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
    - **Prior**: Mean excess return of 0.15 pp with moderate variance.
    - **Evidence Update**:
      - Nasdaq record close suggests a slight increase in expected outperformance.
      - Fed rate cut expectation suggests a slight decrease in expected outperformance.
      - Net effect: The posterior distribution remains centered around a small positive excess return, but with increased uncertainty due to mixed signals.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: The tech sector's volatility and potential macroeconomic shifts could lead to larger deviations than expected.
    - **Alternative Scenario**: A stronger-than-expected market reaction to the Fed rate cut could lead to the S&P 500 outperforming.
    - **Adjustment**: Widen the distribution to account for these uncertainties and potential tail risks.
    
    ### 6. Final Percentiles
    Given the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the excess return of Nasdaq-100 Futures over S&P 500 Futures are:
    
    P10: -0.10  
    P20: 0.00  
    P40: 0.10  
    P60: 0.20  
    P80: 0.30  
    P90: 0.40

## Per-model

- **OpenRouter-Default** ok=True time=12122ms cost=$10.7075 parsed={'P10': 1.0, 'P50': 10.0, 'P90': 2019.0}

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The historical base rate for the 10-Year Treasury Yield from 2019 to 2025 typically ranges from 0.5% to 4.5%, with a focus on the post-COVID recovery period (2021-2023) where yields fluctuated between 1.0% and 3.5%. Given the current economic context, a prior centered around 3.5% is appropriate, reflecting the upper range of recent historical data. The variance is moderate, reflecting typical fluctuations in yield due to economic conditions and policy changes.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - The current situation is similar to the base case in terms of the general economic recovery and ongoing inflation concerns. However, it differs due to the Fed's unusual signaling of rate cuts, which is not typical in historical tightening cycles. This suggests a potential downward shift in yields, although resistance from the bond market may counteract this to some extent.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Fed rate cut signals (↓): This evidence suggests a moderate likelihood of lower yields, as rate cuts typically reduce yields.
       - Bond market resistance (↑): This factor supports higher yields, as resistance to rate cuts may limit their impact.
       - Increased volatility (↓): This suggests a small likelihood of fluctuations, potentially leading to lower yields.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - Starting with a prior centered at 3.5%, the evidence of Fed rate cuts suggests a downward adjustment. The bond market resistance provides an upward pressure, but the net effect is a slight decrease in the expected yield. The posterior distribution is thus centered slightly below 3.5%, with a slightly increased variance to account for market volatility.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The forecast may underestimate the potential for unexpected economic data or geopolitical events to influence yields. An alternative forecast might emphasize the bond market's resistance, suggesting a higher yield. However, given the Fed's clear signaling, the downward pressure is more plausible. Adjustments are made to account for tail risks, ensuring the percentiles reflect potential volatility.
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the 10-Year Treasury Yield are as follows:
    
    P10: 3.1  
    P20: 3.2  
    P40: 3.3  
    P60: 3.4  
    P80: 3.5  
    P90: 3.6
