### **Research Plan**

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the historical frequency of direct U.S. financial bailouts to countries, especially in Latin America?** This will establish the reference class and a base rate.
*   **Q2: What is the current, acute state of Argentina's economy that would necessitate a bailout?** This involves assessing foreign reserve levels, currency stability, and near-term debt obligations.
*   **Q3: What is the nature of the political and ideological relationship between the U.S. (Trump) and Argentine (Milei) administrations?** This will determine the political will for a bailout.
*   **Q4: What are the specific mechanisms for U.S. financial support (swap lines, ESF loans), and what are the precedents for their use?** This clarifies the likely form of any assistance.
*   **Q5: What are the key arguments for and against a U.S. bailout from the U.S. perspective?** This includes geopolitical considerations (e.g., countering China), domestic politics, and moral hazard concerns.
*   **Q6: What recent events and statements (within the last 6 months) signal the likelihood of a bailout before year-end 2025?** This focuses the analysis on the most relevant, time-sensitive information.

**2. Search Queries:**

*   **Q1:** `US Treasury Exchange Stabilization Fund history`, `US bilateral loans to foreign countries`, `Federal Reserve swap lines emerging markets history`, `US Mexico bailout 1995`.
*   **Q2:** `Argentina central bank net foreign reserves 2025`, `Argentina peso exchange rate pressure September 2025`, `Argentina IMF payment schedule 2026`, `Argentina economic outlook Q4 2025`.
*   **Q3:** `Trump Milei relationship`, `US conservative support for Javier Milei`, `US policy Argentina Trump administration 2025`.
*   **Q4:** `US Treasury ESF loan conditions`, `How do Federal Reserve swap lines work`, `US government purchase foreign sovereign debt`.
*   **Q5:** `US strategic interests Argentina`, `China influence Argentina economy`, `US domestic opposition to foreign bailouts`.
*   **Q6:** `US Treasury Secretary Bessent Argentina comments September 2025`, `Trump statement on Argentina help`, `Argentina currency controls lifted 2025 impact`.

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

The historical base rate for direct U.S. bailouts (outside of IMF-led programs) is very low. The 1995 Mexico "Tequila Crisis" bailout is the most prominent modern example. However, the current situation has unique features. Argentina, despite initial successes under Milei's austerity (falling inflation, budget surplus), is facing a classic currency crisis due to low reserves and the lifting of currency controls. The key variable is the strong ideological alignment between President Milei and a U.S. Trump administration. This creates significant political will. Recent statements from the U.S. Treasury explicitly mention a potential $20 billion swap line, a powerful signal of intent. Trump's subsequent downplaying of the term "bailout" while affirming "help" suggests a move to manage domestic political optics rather than a withdrawal of support. The primary driver is the U.S. desire to see Milei's free-market experiment succeed as a regional model and to counter Chinese influence. The main constraint is potential domestic political backlash in the U.S. against a "bailout." The short time horizon (before 2026) means any action would be a response to an acute, near-term crisis, which the current currency pressure represents.

**4. Draft Comprehensive Answer:**

---

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Direct U.S. Bilateral Bailouts of Middle-Income Nations:** This is the most specific class. These events are rare, often occurring once a decade or less. The 1995 U.S. bailout of Mexico ($20 billion via the Exchange Stabilization Fund) is the canonical example. The U.S. typically prefers to work through the IMF. **Base Rate: <5%** in any given year for a specific country.
2.  **Establishment of New Fed Swap Lines for Non-Systemic Economies:** The Federal Reserve maintains standing swap lines with major central banks (ECB, BoJ, etc.). Ad-hoc lines for emerging markets are less common but were used during the 2008 and 2020 crises (e.g., for Brazil, Mexico). An Argentina-specific line would be unusual but not unprecedented in a crisis. **Base Rate: 5-10%** probability of being established during a major crisis period.
3.  **Major U.S. Financial Support Packages to Key Geopolitical Allies:** This is a broader class where the U.S. provides significant financial aid to prevent instability in a strategically important country. While often military, it can be economic. Given Argentina's new status as a key ideological ally for the Trump administration, this class is relevant. **Base Rate: 15-20%** during a period of acute need for a key ally.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-06-05** OECD forecasts strong 5.2% GDP growth for Argentina in 2025, a significant turnaround. (↓) — Suggests underlying economic recovery, potentially reducing the need for emergency aid.
*   **2025-07-02** Reports highlight Argentina's success in slashing monthly inflation to 1.5% by May 2025. (↓) — Reinforces the narrative of successful reforms, making a bailout seem less necessary.
*   **2025-09-16** Argentina's draft budget projects strong 5% growth and moderating inflation for 2026. (↓) — Official government optimism signals confidence in their ability to manage without external crisis support.
*   **2025-09-19** Argentina's central bank is reported to be heavily intervening to defend the peso, using up scarce reserves. (↑) — Indicates the economic situation is becoming critical and that domestic resources are insufficient.
*   **2025-09-24** U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent announces plans for a potential $20 billion swap line to support Argentina. (↑↑) — The strongest signal of direct U.S. intent to provide a financial backstop, moving from possibility to active planning.
*   **2025-09-26** News reports frame the situation as Argentina now needing U.S. help despite earlier successes due to currency pressure. (↑) — Confirms the narrative has shifted from "reform success" to "impending crisis."
*   **2025-09-23** Trump downplays the "bailout" label but affirms the U.S. will "help" Argentina. (↔ / ↑) — A slight rhetorical retreat for domestic political reasons, but confirms the underlying willingness to act, increasing the overall probability.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Argentina's Net Foreign Reserve Levels:** Critically low reserves would force Argentina to either default, hyperinflate, or seek an immediate external anchor. This is the primary trigger for a bailout. (Large)
2.  **Ideological Alignment (Trump-Milei):** The U.S. administration sees Milei's success as a validation of its own economic philosophy and a bulwark against leftism in the region. This creates powerful political will. (Large)
3.  **Geopolitical Competition with China:** The U.S. has a strong incentive to prevent a key South American economy from turning to China for financial rescue, which would increase Beijing's regional influence. (Moderate)
4.  **U.S. Domestic Politics:** An "America First" sentiment could create political costs for the Trump administration for bailing out a foreign country. This explains the careful rhetoric ("help," not "bailout"). (Moderate ↓)
5.  **IMF Program Status:** If Argentina remains in good standing with the IMF, the U.S. may prefer to channel support through that institution. A direct bilateral bailout signals a desire to bypass IMF conditionality or act more quickly. (Small)
6.  **Peso Exchange Rate Stability:** A sudden, sharp devaluation of the peso could trigger social unrest and economic chaos, forcing the U.S. to act quickly to ensure regional stability. (Large)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Exceptional Political Alignment:** Unlike most historical cases, the U.S. and Argentine leaders are exceptionally aligned ideologically and personally. President Trump has a vested interest in seeing the "Milei experiment" succeed.
*   **Bypass of Institutional Norms:** A Trump administration is more likely than its predecessors to favor fast, bilateral action (like using the ESF) over slower, multilateral processes (like working through the IMF).
*   **Explicit High-Level Signaling:** It is highly unusual for a U.S. Treasury Secretary to publicly float a specific, large number ($20 billion) for a potential swap line before a deal is finalized. This suggests advanced planning and serious intent.
*   **Nature of the "Ask":** Argentina is not asking for a traditional handout but for a backstop (like a swap line) to support its own free-market reforms, a narrative that is much more palatable to U.S. conservatives than typical bailouts.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (e.g., 10-15%, "n" of 10) based on the rarity of direct U.S. bailouts and the short time horizon.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Explicit signaling from U.S. Treasury on a $20B swap line is powerful, direct evidence of intent.
    *   (↑ Large) Acute currency pressure and reserve depletion in Argentina create a clear and present need.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Strong ideological alignment between Trump and Milei provides the political will that is often absent.
    *   (↓ Small) Milei's earlier economic successes (inflation, budget) slightly reduce the perceived need, but this is now dated evidence.
    *   (↓ Small) Trump's rhetorical hedge on the word "bailout" suggests sensitivity to domestic politics, which could constrain the form or timing of aid.
*   **Net effect:** The recent, strong evidence from the U.S. Treasury and the acute need in Argentina should overwhelm the low base rate. The posterior should move significantly upward, likely to >50%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Argentina's net foreign reserves fall below a critical threshold (e.g., $0).
    *   The gap between the official and parallel "blue chip swap" exchange rates widens dramatically.
    *   Official travel by the Argentine Economy Minister or Central Bank Governor to Washington D.C.
    *   Statements of support for a bailout from influential Republicans in the U.S. Congress.
    *   Further sharp, uncontrolled depreciation of the peso.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The Argentine peso stabilizes without major intervention for several consecutive weeks.
    *   Argentina successfully secures a significant alternative source of financing (e.g., from private markets or another sovereign).
    *   Prominent conservative U.S. media outlets (e.g., Fox News, Breitbart) begin to campaign against "bailing out" Argentina.
    *   The U.S. Treasury announces it will instead support an expanded IMF program for Argentina.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution requires a *draw* from a swap line, not just its establishment. A line could be opened as a deterrent without being used before 2026, which would resolve as "No."
*   **Rhetoric vs. Action:** President Trump's public statements are notoriously volatile. His support could be withdrawn or altered based on domestic political calculations, despite his administration's current signals.
*   **Timing is Tight:** The horizon is less than three months. Bureaucratic and political processes for approving and implementing a major financial package, even a swap line, can be slow. A crisis would need to be acute *now* to trigger action before year-end.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The true state of Argentina's reserves and the private details of U.S.-Argentine negotiations are not fully public. The situation could be better or worse than it appears.
*   **Form of "Help":** U.S. "help" could come in a form that does not meet the resolution criteria, such as technical assistance, political backing for an IMF deal, or encouraging private U.S. investment.

### Final Research Summary
A direct U.S. bailout is historically rare, but the unique combination of Argentina's acute currency crisis and the powerful ideological alignment between the Milei and Trump administrations makes it a strong possibility. Recent explicit statements from the U.S. Treasury about a $20 billion support package are the key evidence, suggesting the political will exists to act decisively before the situation deteriorates further.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical frequency of direct U.S. financial bailouts to countries, especially in Latin America, is low. The most notable example is the 1995 U.S. bailout of Mexico during the "Tequila Crisis." The U.S. typically prefers to work through the IMF for such interventions. Therefore, a reasonable base rate for a direct U.S. bailout of Argentina would be around 5-10% in any given year, considering the rarity of such events.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Argentina is facing a significant economic crisis with currency instability and low reserves, similar to situations where the U.S. has intervened in the past.
   - Differences: The current political alignment between the Trump administration and President Milei is unusually strong, which could increase the likelihood of U.S. intervention. Additionally, the explicit mention of a $20 billion swap line by the U.S. Treasury is a strong signal of potential support.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **U.S. Treasury's $20 billion swap line announcement**: This is a strong indicator of intent to support Argentina, significantly increasing the probability of a bailout. Likelihood ratio: High.
   - **Argentina's economic reforms and initial successes**: While these suggest some stability, the ongoing currency crisis and reserve depletion indicate a need for external support. Likelihood ratio: Moderate.
   - **Trump's downplaying of the "bailout" term**: This suggests sensitivity to domestic political optics but does not negate the underlying intent to provide support. Likelihood ratio: Moderate.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 10% (0.1)
   - Likelihood ratio for U.S. Treasury's announcement: High (e.g., 3)
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.1 × 3 = 0.3
   - Posterior probability = 0.3 / (1 + 0.3) = 0.23 or 23%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The explicit announcement of a swap line is a strong signal, but the actual draw from it is necessary for resolution. Domestic political opposition in the U.S. could still derail plans.
   - Alternative scenario: Argentina could secure alternative financing or stabilize its economy without U.S. intervention, reducing the need for a bailout.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of non-resolution due to timing or alternative solutions, slightly reducing the probability.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the strong evidence of intent from the U.S. Treasury and the acute economic situation in Argentina, the probability of a U.S. bailout before 2026 is moderately high but not certain. Adjusting for potential alternative scenarios and domestic political factors, the final probability is:
   
Final: 35%

# Will the United States bailout Argentina before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate reference class for U.S. bailouts of foreign countries, particularly those similar to Argentina.

The most relevant reference class is "Direct U.S. bilateral financial bailouts of middle-income nations facing currency/debt crises." These events are rare, with the 1995 Mexico bailout ($20 billion via the Exchange Stabilization Fund) being the canonical example. The U.S. typically prefers to work through the IMF rather than providing direct bilateral support.

Looking at historical data:
- The U.S. has provided direct bilateral financial support to very few countries outside of wartime or major geopolitical crises
- For economic crises, the U.S. has strongly preferred multilateral approaches through the IMF
- Direct swap lines from the Federal Reserve to non-systemic economies are uncommon

Given the short timeframe (less than 3 months until 2026), and the historical rarity of such events, I'll set a base rate of **10%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Argentina is experiencing a classic currency crisis with depleting reserves
- The situation involves a middle-income Latin American country (similar to Mexico 1995)
- There's concern about regional stability and contagion effects
- The U.S. has strategic interests in the region

**Key differences:**
- **Exceptional political alignment:** Unlike most historical cases, there is unusually strong ideological alignment between Trump and Milei. Both are right-wing populists with similar economic views.
- **Explicit high-level signaling:** The U.S. Treasury Secretary has publicly mentioned a specific $20 billion swap line, which is an unusually concrete and public signal of intent.
- **Form of support:** The proposed mechanism (swap line) is less politically contentious than a direct loan or bailout.
- **Timing constraints:** With less than 3 months until 2026, any action would need to happen very quickly.
- **Trump's personal interest:** Trump has personally expressed interest in helping Argentina, framing it as supporting a like-minded leader.

These differences, particularly the explicit Treasury statement about a swap line and the strong ideological alignment, significantly increase the probability above the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: U.S. Treasury Secretary announced plans for a $20 billion swap line (September 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the U.S. is planning to bailout Argentina, a Treasury Secretary would likely make such an announcement
- P(E|~H): Very low (~0.1) - If no bailout is planned, it would be unusual for the Treasury Secretary to specifically mention a $20B figure
- Likelihood ratio: ~9.0 (strongly increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Trump downplayed the term "bailout" but affirmed "help" for Argentina**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If planning support but concerned about domestic politics, this phrasing makes sense
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Could be diplomatic rhetoric without concrete plans
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0 (moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 3: Argentina's central bank is heavily intervening to defend the peso, using scarce reserves**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - A genuine crisis increases likelihood of U.S. intervention
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Many countries face currency pressure without U.S. bailouts
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6 (slightly increases probability)

**Evidence 4: Earlier economic successes under Milei (inflation reduction, budget surplus)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Success makes Argentina more "worthy" of support
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.6) - Success might suggest Argentina can manage without external help
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.83 (slightly decreases probability)

**Evidence 5: Short timeframe until 2026 (less than 3 months)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - Crises can accelerate decision-making
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Bureaucratic processes for financial support often take months
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.75 (moderately decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior probability of 10% (odds of 1:9)

First update using Evidence 1 (Treasury Secretary announcement):
- Prior odds: 1:9 (0.1 / 0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 9.0
- Posterior odds: 9:9 = 1:1
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+1) = 50%

Second update using Evidence 2 (Trump's statements):
- Prior odds: 1:1 (0.5 / 0.5)
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 2:1
- Posterior probability: 2/(2+1) = 67%

Third update using Evidence 3 (Argentina's currency intervention):
- Prior odds: 2:1 (0.67 / 0.33)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.6
- Posterior odds: 3.2:1
- Posterior probability: 3.2/(3.2+1) = 76%

Fourth update using Evidence 4 (earlier economic successes):
- Prior odds: 3.2:1 (0.76 / 0.24)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.83
- Posterior odds: 2.66:1
- Posterior probability: 2.66/(2.66+1) = 73%

Fifth update using Evidence 5 (short timeframe):
- Prior odds: 2.66:1 (0.73 / 0.27)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.75
- Posterior odds: 2:1
- Posterior probability: 2/(2+1) = 67%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the Treasury Secretary's statement. Public statements don't always translate to action, especially in the Trump administration.
- The definition of "bailout" matters. The question specifies three criteria, but a swap line might be established without Argentina drawing on it before 2026.
- I might be underestimating domestic U.S. political resistance to foreign bailouts in the current "America First" climate.
- The timeframe is very tight - bureaucratic processes might delay any action beyond 2025.

**Alternative forecast:**
A more skeptical forecast might put the probability at 30-40%, arguing that:
1. Historical precedent strongly suggests the U.S. prefers multilateral approaches through the IMF
2. The short timeframe makes implementation difficult
3. Trump's statements are often not followed by concrete action
4. Domestic political considerations could block a bailout

**Rebuttals to the alternative:**
1. The Treasury Secretary's specific mention of a $20B swap line suggests planning is already advanced
2. The ideological alignment between Trump and Milei creates unique political will
3. A swap line is technically simpler to implement than other forms of support
4. The framing as "helping" rather than "bailout" could mitigate domestic political concerns

After considering these points, I'll adjust my forecast slightly downward to account for the tight timeframe and implementation challenges.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate, the specific evidence (especially the Treasury Secretary's explicit mention of a $20B swap line), the strong ideological alignment between Trump and Milei, but also accounting for the tight timeframe and implementation challenges, I arrive at a final probability of 65%.

Final: 65%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate reference class is direct, bilateral financial rescue packages from the United States to a middle-income country, outside of standard IMF-led programs. These events are historically rare. The 1995 U.S. bailout of Mexico using the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) is the most prominent modern precedent. Other mechanisms like ad-hoc Federal Reserve swap lines for emerging markets have been used, but sparingly, typically during global systemic crises (e.g., 2008, 2020).

Given the rarity of such interventions for any specific country in a given year (less than 5%), the base rate for a bailout happening in the short, three-month window (Oct-Dec 2025) is very low. However, the prompt specifies that a crisis is already underway, which is a precondition for such an event. A reasonable prior, conditioned on an active crisis but acknowledging the historical rarity and short timeframe, is **10%**.

Prior Odds: 10% probability corresponds to 1-to-9 odds (0.10 / 0.90).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the historical base case in several critical ways that increase the probability of a bailout:

*   **Exceptional Political and Ideological Alignment**: The scenario describes a uniquely strong relationship between the U.S. (Trump) and Argentine (Milei) administrations. The U.S. administration would have a vested interest in ensuring the success of Milei's free-market reforms, viewing it as an ideological and geopolitical victory. This creates a level of political will that is typically absent.
*   **Geopolitical Competition**: The desire to counter Chinese financial influence in Latin America provides a strong strategic incentive for the U.S. to act as the lender of last resort, a factor that was less pronounced in previous decades.
*   **Narrative Framing**: The bailout can be framed not as rewarding failed policies, but as providing a crucial backstop to a promising, pro-market reform agenda facing a temporary (but acute) currency crisis. This makes the action more politically palatable for a conservative U.S. administration.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Several key pieces of recent evidence must be evaluated:

*   **Evidence 1**: The U.S. Treasury Secretary announces plans for a potential **$20 billion swap line** with Argentina (September 2025).
    *   This is extremely strong evidence. A high-level official would not publicly state a specific, large figure unless planning was advanced and the intent was serious. The likelihood of this statement if a bailout is planned (P(E|H)) is very high. The likelihood of such a specific statement if no bailout is planned (P(E|~H)) is very low.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: Very high (>>1), strongly increasing the probability.

*   **Evidence 2**: Argentina's central bank is **heavily intervening and using up scarce reserves** to defend the peso (September 2025).
    *   This confirms the crisis is acute and urgent. A bailout is a response to such a crisis. While a crisis doesn't guarantee a bailout, it is a necessary precondition.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: Moderately high (>1), increasing the probability by confirming the need for immediate action.

*   **Evidence 3**: President Trump **downplays the "bailout" label but affirms the U.S. will "help"** (September 2025).
    *   This is a classic political maneuver to manage domestic optics. Affirming the intent to "help" while reframing the politically toxic term "bailout" is precisely what one would expect if a rescue package were imminent.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: High (>>1), confirming political will at the highest level.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
We can update our 10% prior (1-to-9 odds) with the new evidence.

1.  **Initial Prior Odds**: 1 to 9.
2.  **Update with Treasury Announcement**: The explicit mention of a $20 billion swap line is a powerful signal. A conservative likelihood ratio might be 6-to-1 (i.e., this evidence is 6 times more likely if a bailout is happening than if it isn't).
    *   *Posterior Odds = (1/9) × 6 = 6/9 = 2/3.*
    *   This corresponds to a probability of (2/3) / (1 + 2/3) = 40%.
3.  **Update with Crisis Severity & Trump's Statement**: The confirmation of an acute crisis and the President's personal commitment to "help" further increase the odds. This combined evidence might carry a likelihood ratio of 2.5-to-1.
    *   *Final Odds = (2/3) × 2.5 = 5/3.*
    *   **Final Probability = (5/3) / (1 + 5/3) = 5/8 = 62.5%.**

The strong, specific, and recent evidence overwhelms the low base rate, moving the probability from unlikely (10%) to likely (>60%).

### 5. Red Team Thinking
It's crucial to consider scenarios where a bailout does not happen before 2026.

*   **The Announcement as a Deterrent**: The public announcement of a potential swap line might be enough to stabilize the peso by demonstrating a credible backstop. If this "jawboning" works, Argentina may not need to actually draw from the line before 2026, which would mean the event resolves as "No".
*   **Timing and Bureaucracy**: The three-month window is very tight. Even with political will, the technical and bureaucratic steps to finalize and implement a major financial package could push the actual transaction into early 2026.
*   **Domestic Political Opposition**: Despite the administration's framing, a strong "America First" backlash from conservative media or Congress could force a reversal or a watering-down of the "help" into something that doesn't meet the resolution criteria.

These counterarguments are plausible and introduce significant uncertainty, preventing the forecast from being extremely high (e.g., >80%). However, the evidence of an acute crisis suggests that a mere announcement may not be sufficient and that actual funds will be needed urgently. The political alignment appears strong enough to overcome likely domestic hurdles and expedite the process.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for a direct U.S. bailout is very low. However, the current situation is exceptional due to the powerful ideological alignment between the U.S. and Argentine leadership, creating immense political will. This is strongly corroborated by recent, explicit statements from the U.S. Treasury about a specific $20 billion support plan and personal confirmation of "help" from the U.S. President. While the short timeline and the possibility of the announcement itself being a sufficient deterrent are key risks, the evidence of an acute currency crisis makes an actual transfer of funds before 2026 the most likely outcome.

Final: 63%
