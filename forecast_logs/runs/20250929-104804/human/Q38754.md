### Reference class & base rates
-   **Dissolutions in the French Fifth Republic (1958-Present):** There have been five dissolutions of the National Assembly prior to 2024: 1962 (de Gaulle), 1968 (de Gaulle), 1981 (Mitterrand), 1988 (Mitterrand), and 1997 (Chirac). This yields a rough base rate of one dissolution every ~13 years, or approximately **7-8% in any given year**. However, these are not random events; they are clustered around presidential elections or major crises.
-   **Presidential Terms with a Hung Parliament:** A more specific reference class is periods where the President lacks an absolute majority. This occurred for Macron from 2022-2024, during which he did not dissolve parliament. It also occurred for Mitterrand from 1988-1993. This suggests that "muddling through" with a minority government is a viable, and perhaps default, alternative to dissolution. This reference class suggests a **lower base rate, perhaps 5-10% over a comparable 1.5-year period**.
-   **Dissolutions Following a Prior Dissolution:** This is an extremely narrow reference class with no direct modern precedent. Calling a snap election, having it fail to produce a majority, and then calling *another one* shortly after is historically unprecedented. This suggests the political bar for a second attempt is exceptionally high, implying a **very low base rate, perhaps <5%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2024-07-07] Hung parliament results confirmed, with the left-wing NFP winning a plurality, Macron's Ensemble second, and the far-right RN third. ↑ — Establishes the fundamental condition of parliamentary gridlock that could necessitate a new election.
-   [2024-09-05] Macron appoints conservative Michel Barnier as Prime Minister in an attempt to build a cross-party government of national unity. ↓ — Represents a clear attempt to avoid dissolution by seeking a technocratic, compromise-based path to govern, reducing immediate pressure.
-   [2024-10-12] Government signals intent to use Article 49.3 to pass the 2025 budget without a vote, anticipating parliamentary opposition. ↑ — Using this constitutional tool highlights the government's inability to build a majority and invites motions of no confidence, a primary trigger for a crisis.
-   [2024-12-04] Barnier's government is brought down by a motion of no confidence, the first successful one since 1962, after using Article 49.3. ↑↑ — Creates a major political crisis. While Macron's first move is to appoint a new PM, it brings the option of dissolution firmly onto the table if no stable government can be formed.
-   [2024-12-13] François Bayrou is appointed Prime Minister, another attempt to find a viable governing arrangement without new elections. ↓ — Shows Macron's continued preference for avoiding another election, exhausting other options first even after a government collapse.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Sustained Parliamentary Gridlock:** The inability of the government to pass essential legislation, particularly the annual budget. A complete blockage is the strongest driver for dissolution. (Large ↑)
-   **Successful Motion of No Confidence:** The collapse of a government forces the President's hand. He must either appoint a new Prime Minister who can command a majority (difficult in this parliament) or dissolve the Assembly. (Large ↑)
-   **Constitutional Timeline:** Article 12 of the French Constitution forbids a dissolution within one year of the preceding one. As the last election was July 2024, Macron cannot call another one before **July 2025**. This creates a hard constraint and a major barrier. (Large ↓)
-   **Political Trauma & Risk Aversion:** The June 2024 snap election was a disastrous gamble for Macron. His party was weakened, and his authority damaged. The political cost of a second failed gamble would be immense, creating a powerful incentive to avoid it. (Large ↓)
-   **Favorable Shift in Polling:** If polls were to show a dramatic and sustained surge for Macron's Ensemble bloc, suggesting a clear path to a majority, his risk appetite might return. This is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition. (Moderate ↑)
-   **External Shock:** A major national crisis (e.g., security, economic, social) could scramble political alignments and provide Macron with a pretext to seek a new, more stable mandate to address it. (Small ↑)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Unprecedented "Triple Bloc" Parliament:** Unlike past hung parliaments, the current Assembly is fractured into three large, mutually hostile blocs (left, center, far-right), making stable coalitions or even issue-by-issue compromises exceptionally difficult. This increases the likelihood of deadlock compared to historical precedents.
-   **Post-Failed Gamble Context:** This is not a dissolution from a position of strength (like Mitterrand in '81) or to resolve a long-running stalemate. It would be a second attempt after a recent, self-inflicted, and catastrophic political failure. The credibility barrier is much higher.
-   **Severely Constrained Timeline:** The one-year constitutional ban means the question's time window (until Jan 1, 2026) contains only a **six-month period (July-Dec 2025)** where a dissolution is legally possible. This drastically reduces the opportunity compared to a typical multi-year period.
-   **President's Lame-Duck Status:** Macron is in his second and final term. His political capital is finite and diminishing. A failed dissolution would render him completely powerless, while even a successful one would yield a majority for his successor's party, not for him personally in 2027.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, blending the general base rate (~7-8%/year) with the hung-parliament context, might be around **15%**, with an equivalent n of ~15, reflecting the historical rarity but acknowledging the unstable setup.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   ↓ (Large): The constitutional ban until July 2025 cuts the effective time window for the event to occur by more than half.
    -   ↓ (Large): The political fallout from the failed 2024 gamble creates immense risk aversion for Macron and his allies, making a repeat highly improbable without a dramatic change in circumstances.
    -   ↑ (Large): The three-bloc structure of parliament makes durable gridlock and government collapse (via no-confidence vote) far more likely than in previous hung parliaments.
    -   ↓ (Moderate): Macron's repeated attempts to appoint new Prime Ministers (Barnier, Bayrou) after the 2024 election and subsequent government collapse demonstrate a strong revealed preference for avoiding another dissolution.
-   **Net effect:** The powerful, concrete downward pressures (constitutional timeline, political trauma) appear to outweigh the upward pressure from parliamentary gridlock.

To forecast the probability of French President Emmanuel Macron calling another snap legislative election before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for dissolutions in the French Fifth Republic is approximately 7-8% per year, based on historical data. However, given the specific context of a hung parliament and the unprecedented nature of calling a second snap election shortly after a failed one, a more appropriate base rate might be lower. Considering the historical rarity and the specific challenges, a base rate of around 5% seems reasonable.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a hung parliament, which historically increases the likelihood of dissolution due to potential gridlock.
   - Differences: The recent snap election gamble by Macron was politically costly, and the constitutional constraint prevents another dissolution before July 2025. Additionally, the political landscape is fractured into three major blocs, making stable governance challenging but also making another dissolution risky.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Constitutional Constraint**: The inability to call an election before July 2025 significantly reduces the probability, as it limits the time window for a dissolution to occur. This is a strong downward pressure.
   - **Political Risk Aversion**: The political cost of another failed gamble is high, suggesting Macron would be cautious about calling another election without a clear path to success. This is another strong downward pressure.
   - **Parliamentary Gridlock**: The three-bloc structure increases the likelihood of gridlock and government collapse, which could pressure Macron to call an election. This is an upward pressure.
   - **Attempts to Avoid Dissolution**: Macron's efforts to appoint new Prime Ministers indicate a preference for avoiding another election, which is a moderate downward pressure.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior of 5%, the strong downward pressures from the constitutional constraint and political risk aversion outweigh the upward pressure from potential gridlock.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
   - Given the strong downward pressures, the posterior probability is likely to be lower than the prior.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could arise from underestimating the potential for an external shock or a dramatic shift in polling that might change Macron's calculus.
   - An alternative scenario where Macron sees a clear path to a majority could increase the probability, but current evidence does not strongly support this.
   - Adjustments should account for the limited time window and the high political cost of another failed election.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the evidence and the constraints, the probability of Macron calling another snap election before 2026 is low. The strong downward pressures from the constitutional and political context suggest a probability lower than the initial base rate.

Final: 3%

# Will Macron call another snap legislative election before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for Macron calling another snap election before January 1, 2026.

The most appropriate reference class is the frequency of snap elections in the French Fifth Republic, particularly in situations of parliamentary deadlock. From the research report:
- There have been five dissolutions of the National Assembly since 1958 (over ~66 years)
- This yields a base rate of approximately 7-8% in any given year
- However, when focusing on periods with a hung parliament, the rate might be 5-10% over a comparable 1.5-year period
- For the specific case of a second dissolution following a failed first attempt, the base rate is extremely low (<5%)

Given that we're looking at a specific 15-month window (from now until January 2026), and considering the unique circumstances, I'll start with a prior of **10%**.

This prior reflects the historical rarity of dissolutions while acknowledging the unstable parliamentary situation.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- France has a hung parliament with no clear majority, creating potential for gridlock
- The president has constitutional authority to dissolve parliament (after July 2025)
- There is significant political polarization among the three main blocs

**Key differences:**
- Constitutional constraint: Macron cannot call another election until July 2025 due to the one-year ban after the previous dissolution, leaving only a 6-month window (July-Dec 2025) for this to occur
- This would be an unprecedented second consecutive snap election, following a failed political gamble
- The parliament is uniquely divided into three hostile blocs (left, center, right) rather than the more typical two-bloc division
- Macron is in his second and final term, with diminishing political capital

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood compared to the historical base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Constitutional timeline constraint**
- P(E|H): If Macron were to call another snap election, it would have to occur after July 2025 due to constitutional constraints = 1.0
- P(E|~H): If Macron doesn't call another snap election, this constraint is irrelevant = 1.0
- Likelihood ratio = 1.0
- This constraint doesn't change the probability but narrows the window to just 6 months, which indirectly reduces the likelihood

**Evidence 2: Appointment of compromise Prime Ministers**
- P(E|H): If Macron intends to call another snap election, he would likely not invest effort in appointing compromise PMs like Barnier and Bayrou = 0.3
- P(E|~H): If Macron wants to avoid another snap election, he would try multiple PM appointments to find a workable government = 0.9
- Likelihood ratio = 0.3/0.9 = 0.33
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Three-bloc parliamentary structure**
- P(E|H): If Macron calls another snap election, it would likely be due to complete parliamentary gridlock from the three hostile blocs = 0.8
- P(E|~H): If Macron doesn't call another snap election, it would mean the three blocs found some way to govern despite differences = 0.4
- Likelihood ratio = 0.8/0.4 = 2.0
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Political fallout from failed 2024 gamble**
- P(E|H): If Macron calls another snap election, he would be willing to risk another political failure = 0.3
- P(E|~H): If Macron doesn't call another snap election, it would align with risk aversion after his previous failure = 0.9
- Likelihood ratio = 0.3/0.9 = 0.33
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 10% (odds of 1:9):

**Update on Evidence 2 (compromise PMs):**
- Prior odds = 0.10/0.90 = 0.111
- Likelihood ratio = 0.33
- Posterior odds = 0.111 × 0.33 = 0.037
- Posterior probability = 0.037/(1 + 0.037) = 3.6%

**Update on Evidence 3 (three-bloc structure):**
- Prior odds = 0.036/0.964 = 0.037
- Likelihood ratio = 2.0
- Posterior odds = 0.037 × 2.0 = 0.074
- Posterior probability = 0.074/(1 + 0.074) = 6.9%

**Update on Evidence 4 (political fallout):**
- Prior odds = 0.069/0.931 = 0.074
- Likelihood ratio = 0.33
- Posterior odds = 0.074 × 0.33 = 0.024
- Posterior probability = 0.024/(1 + 0.024) = 2.4%

After incorporating the key evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 2.4%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the severity of parliamentary gridlock that could emerge
- A major crisis (economic, security, social) could dramatically change Macron's calculus
- If polls showed a clear path to a majority for Macron's allies, his risk appetite might increase

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast might be 10-15%, arguing that:
- Parliamentary deadlock is likely to worsen over time
- The use of Article 49.3 to pass budgets will invite more no-confidence votes
- If multiple governments fall in succession, Macron may have no choice but to call new elections

**Rebuttal:**
While these scenarios are possible, they face significant counterweights:
- The constitutional timeline constraint means any dissolution must occur in the final months of 2025
- Macron's political self-interest strongly favors avoiding another risky election
- All political actors are aware of the risks of another election and have incentives to find compromises

Given these considerations, I will adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for the possibility of severe gridlock or external shocks, but not dramatically.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the historical base rates, the unique constraints of the current situation, and the evidence available, I forecast a 3% probability that Macron will call another snap legislative election before 2026.

Final: 3%

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The question asks about a specific future period (from today, September 29, 2025, to January 1, 2026) under very specific circumstances. A broad base rate, like the historical frequency of dissolutions in the Fifth Republic (~7-8% per year), is not very informative. A more relevant, but still imperfect, reference class is the behavior of presidents during periods of a hung parliament. Historically (Mitterrand 1988-93, Macron 2022-24), the tendency has been to "muddle through" rather than dissolve to resolve gridlock.

However, the current situation is defined by an impending, predictable crisis: the passage of the 2026 budget. This is a known flashpoint that makes the next three months more volatile than a typical quarter. Therefore, I will establish a prior probability of **15%** for a dissolution occurring in this specific 3-month window. This is higher than a simple time-pro-rated historical average, reflecting the acute political instability and the specific trigger event of the budget debate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This situation differs from historical hung parliaments in several key ways:

*   **Similarities:** The core problem is the same: a President's government lacks a stable majority, making it difficult to pass legislation, especially the budget.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Post-Failed Gamble:** This is not a standard hung parliament; it is one created by President Macron's own failed snap election in 2024. This creates a powerful political and psychological barrier against trying again, as a second failure would be catastrophic for his legacy.
    *   **Precedent of Collapse:** Unlike previous periods of "muddling through," a government (Prime Minister Barnier's) has already been brought down by a no-confidence vote in December 2024. This proves that the opposition blocs (the left-wing NFP and the right-wing RN) are capable of coordinating to topple a government, making the threat of collapse more credible.
    *   **Time Constraint:** The one-year constitutional ban on a second dissolution has now expired (as of July 2025). Macron is legally able to act, but the window before the question resolves is short (3 months).

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the event that Macron calls a snap election before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: The Bayrou government has survived for nine months (Jan-Sep 2025).** (This is inferred from the research report's timeline ending in Dec 2024 and no mention of a subsequent collapse).
    *   P(E1 | H): If a dissolution were imminent, one would expect the preceding period to be highly unstable, likely involving the collapse of the Bayrou government. Its survival is evidence against the system being completely unworkable.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): The government's survival is highly consistent with a "muddling through" scenario where no election is called.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E1 | H) / P(E1 | ~H) is significantly less than 1. This evidence **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The 2026 budget is the primary legislative task for Autumn 2025.**
    *   P(E2 | H): A crisis over the budget is the most plausible pathway to dissolution. The government will likely use Article 49.3, triggering a no-confidence motion. A government collapse over the budget is a classic trigger for new elections.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): It is also possible the government survives the budget process, either by the no-confidence motion failing or by finding a compromise.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E2 | H) / P(E2 | ~H) is greater than 1. This predictable crisis point **increases** the probability compared to a random 3-month period.

*   **Evidence 3: The political trauma of the 2024 election.**
    *   P(E3 | H): For Macron to dissolve again, he would have to overcome immense internal and external pressure, risking a repeat of a humiliating defeat. This would require either a dramatic, favorable shift in polling or a level of desperation that overrides rational risk assessment.
    *   P(E3 | ~H): This trauma is a primary explanation for why Macron would seek any alternative to another election.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E3 | H) / P(E3 | ~H) is significantly less than 1. This evidence **decreases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

I will use a scenario-based approach to update the 15% prior. The most likely path to a "YES" resolution involves a specific chain of events:

1.  The Bayrou government uses Article 49.3 to pass the 2026 budget. (Probability is very high, ~90%).
2.  This triggers a motion of no confidence, which succeeds because the NFP and RN vote together again. (This is the key uncertainty. They did it once to oust Barnier, but the fact Bayrou's government has survived suggests this is not automatic. I estimate a **25%** probability of a successful motion).
3.  Faced with a second collapsed government, Macron decides to dissolve the Assembly rather than appoint a third Prime Minister. (After a second failure, the "no other option" argument is stronger. I estimate a **40%** probability he chooses this path).

The overall probability of this scenario is the product of these conditional probabilities:
P(YES) ≈ P(Use 49.3) × P(No Confidence Succeeds) × P(Dissolves | Collapse)
P(YES) ≈ 0.90 × 0.25 × 0.40 = 0.09

This calculation updates the initial 15% prior downwards to **9%**. The survival of the Bayrou government for nine months is strong evidence that the "muddling through" equilibrium is more resilient than initially thought, and the bar for the opposition to unite and bring down the government is high.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast of 9% could be too low if I am underestimating Macron's willingness to take risks. He has a history of bold ("Jupiterian") moves. He might see a final gamble as the only way to avoid a lame-duck presidency and shape the political landscape before he leaves office. Furthermore, the opposition parties might be more aggressive in seeking to create chaos than I assume, making a successful no-confidence vote more likely. An alternative forecast of 15-20% is plausible if one believes Macron is a gambler at heart and the opposition is bent on forcing a crisis.

Conversely, the forecast could be too high. The "muddling through" option is the path of least resistance. All major political actors may have an incentive to avoid new elections that could yield a similar or worse result. They may prefer a weak, paralyzed government to the uncertainty of another election. In this view, the opposition will make noise during the budget debate but will ultimately stop short of bringing the government down. This would imply a probability closer to 5%.

Balancing these considerations, the 9% figure, derived from the scenario analysis, seems to correctly weigh the high barriers against the very real, but narrow, path to dissolution. I will round up slightly to account for unforeseen events or a higher-than-expected appetite for risk from the key players.

### 6. Final Forecast

The probability is low but not negligible. It hinges almost entirely on a successful no-confidence vote during the autumn budget session and Macron's subsequent decision to risk a second electoral gamble. While the system has shown surprising resilience over the past nine months, the budget remains a point of maximum danger.

Final: 10%

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   An appropriate base rate for a French president calling a snap legislative election in a hung parliament scenario is around 5-10% over a 1.5-year period, based on historical precedents like Macron's 2022-2024 minority government (no dissolution) and Mitterrand's 1988-1993 cohabitation (no dissolution despite tensions). This reflects "muddling through" as the default. Adjusting for the narrower reference of a second snap election shortly after a failed one (unprecedented, <5% base rate), I select a prior of 15% for the full July-Dec 2025 window, as suggested in the research report's Bayesian sketch. This blends general dissolution rates (~7-8% per year) with the current instability, yielding prior odds of 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.176.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   The current situation is similar to past hung parliaments (e.g., 2022-2024 under Macron), where minority governments survived via compromises or constitutional tools like Article 49.3 without dissolution. It's different due to the unprecedented triple-bloc fracture (left, center, far-right), which heightens gridlock risk compared to bipolar setups. However, the apparent stability under Bayrou from Dec 2024 to Sep 2025 (9+ months) suggests better-than-expected muddling, reducing dissolution likelihood. The post-2024 gamble trauma and lame-duck status also raise the bar higher than historical cases, making aversion stronger.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Stability under Bayrou for 9+ months**: P(E | H) low (~20%, as severe gridlock would likely cause earlier collapse prompting dissolution post-July 2025); P(E | ~H) high (~70%, consistent with muddling through). LR ≈ 0.20 / 0.70 ≈ 0.29 (decreases probability).
   - **Time passed without call (Jul-Sep 2025)**: P(E | H) ≈ 0.5 (assuming uniform timing conditional on H); P(E | ~H) = 1. LR ≈ 0.5 / 1 = 0.5 (decreases probability).
   - **Upcoming budget season (fall 2025)**: P(E | H) high (~60%, as budget crises can trigger dissolution decisions); P(E | ~H) moderate (~40%, but survivable as in prior periods). LR ≈ 0.60 / 0.40 = 1.5 (increases probability).
   - **Political trauma from 2024 gamble**: P(E | H) low (~30%, aversion makes repeat unlikely); P(E | ~H) high (~80%). LR ≈ 0.30 / 0.80 ≈ 0.375 (decreases probability).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   Start with prior odds = 0.176.
   - Update for stability: odds × 0.29 ≈ 0.051 (P ≈ 4.9%).
   - Update for time passed: odds × 0.5 ≈ 0.0255 (P ≈ 2.5%).
   - Update for budget season: odds × 1.5 ≈ 0.0383 (P ≈ 3.7%).
   - Update for political trauma: odds × 0.375 ≈ 0.0144 (P ≈ 1.4%).
   The net posterior is ~5% after qualitative netting (downward factors dominate, but budget risk prevents going too low). Uncertainty remains high due to potential crises, but evidence tilts toward continued muddling.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   Potential overconfidence: I may underestimate tail risks like a sudden budget collapse in Oct-Dec 2025, mirroring 2024's no-confidence vote, especially in a fragile triple-bloc setup. Alternative scenarios include an external shock (e.g., economic downturn) scrambling polls and enabling dissolution (~10% tail weight). Best alternative forecast: 15%, assuming ~50% chance of collapse and ~30% conditional dissolution probability, plausible if Macron sees no viable PM options left. Rebuttal: Historical preference for appointing new PMs (e.g., Bayrou after Barnier) and 2024 trauma make dissolution a last resort; stability evidence outweighs this. I adjust up slightly from 1.4% to 5% to account for tails, avoiding over-narrow confidence.

Final: 5%
