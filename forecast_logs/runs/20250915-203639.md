## Per-model

- **OpenRouter-Default** ok=True time=13656ms cost=$11.3525 parsed={'P10': 1.0, 'P50': 5.0, 'P90': 5.0}

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - For the base rate, I will use the historical biweekly returns of large-cap tech stocks, which typically range from -5% to +5%. Given Nvidia's recent outperformance over Apple by 29 percentage points over the past year, a reasonable prior might be that Nvidia's returns exceed Apple's by 5 percentage points (pp) in a typical biweekly period. This reflects Nvidia's recent strength but also accounts for typical market volatility. The variance is assumed to be around 5 pp, reflecting the typical spread in tech stock returns.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: Both Nvidia and Apple are large-cap tech stocks subject to similar market forces and macroeconomic conditions.
       - Differences: Nvidia's recent AI advancements and strategic contracts provide it with a unique growth trajectory compared to Apple, which has had lukewarm product launches recently. This suggests a potential upward shift in Nvidia's relative performance.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Nvidia's AI chip announcement and cloud contract are positive indicators, likely increasing Nvidia's returns relative to Apple. These factors suggest a moderate upward adjustment.
       - Apple's lukewarm iPhone Air launch is a negative indicator for Apple, suggesting a further relative advantage for Nvidia.
       - Overall, the evidence suggests that Nvidia's returns are more likely to exceed Apple's by more than the prior estimate of 5 pp.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - Prior: Nvidia's returns exceed Apple's by 5 pp, with a variance of 5 pp.
       - Likelihood: Nvidia's positive news (AI chip, cloud contract) and Apple's negative news (lukewarm product launch) suggest a moderate increase in Nvidia's relative returns.
       - Posterior: The mean of the posterior distribution is adjusted upwards to reflect these factors, perhaps to around 7 pp, with a slightly increased variance to account for the uncertainty introduced by market volatility.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence Risk: The forecast could be overly optimistic about Nvidia's prospects. Consider potential negative scenarios, such as regulatory challenges or broader market downturns.
       - Alternative Forecast: A more conservative estimate might suggest only a slight increase over the prior, say to 6 pp, if one assumes that market volatility or unexpected positive news for Apple could counterbalance Nvidia's advantages.
       - Adjustments: Given these considerations, I will slightly adjust the percentiles to account for potential downside risks.
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Based on the analysis, the final percentiles for Nvidia's stock price returns exceeding Apple's in the specified period are as follows:
    P10: 2
    P20: 4
    P40: 6
    P60: 8
    P80: 10
    P90: 12

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the difference in total price returns between Nasdaq-100 Futures and S&P 500 Futures for the period of Sep 29 - Oct 10, 2025, we will follow a Bayesian approach.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Base Rate**: Historically, the Nasdaq-100 has outperformed the S&P 500 by an average of 2-3 percentage points (pp) annually in tech-driven bull markets. Given the biweekly nature of the forecast, a smaller base rate is appropriate. Assuming a normal distribution, we can set a prior mean of 0.1 pp for a two-week period with a standard deviation of 0.5 pp, reflecting typical short-term volatility.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarities**: Both indices are influenced by macroeconomic factors and investor sentiment. The tech sector's historical volatility and growth potential are consistent with past trends.
    - **Differences**: Current high interest rates and regulatory scrutiny are atypical, potentially limiting tech growth and Nasdaq-100 outperformance.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **Strong Tech Earnings (↑)**: Recent strong earnings reports from major tech firms suggest a positive outlook for the Nasdaq-100, making higher outcomes more likely.
    - **Rising Interest Rates (↓)**: Higher interest rates typically pressure growth stocks, making lower outcomes more likely.
    - **Positive Economic Data (↑)**: Resilience in consumer spending benefits both indices, but may favor tech slightly more.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
    - **Prior**: Mean = 0.1 pp, SD = 0.5 pp.
    - **Likelihood Adjustments**:
      - **Tech Earnings**: Increase likelihood of higher returns by 1.5×.
      - **Interest Rates**: Decrease likelihood of higher returns by 1.5×.
      - **Economic Data**: Slight increase in likelihood of higher returns.
    - **Posterior**: Given the mixed evidence, the posterior mean remains close to the prior, with a slight upward adjustment due to positive tech earnings and economic data. The variance remains similar, reflecting ongoing uncertainty.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: The forecast should account for potential overconfidence in tech sector resilience. Interest rate impacts may be underestimated.
    - **Tail Risks**: Consider the possibility of sudden regulatory changes or unexpected economic downturns.
    - **Alternative Forecast**: A scenario where interest rates rise further could lead to underperformance of the Nasdaq-100 relative to the S&P 500.
    
    ### 6. Final Percentiles
    - **Adjusted Percentiles**: Considering the evidence and potential risks, the forecast percentiles are adjusted to reflect a slightly positive outlook for Nasdaq-100 outperformance, but with caution due to interest rate pressures.

- **2025-07-30** ↓ — Inflation data shows signs of cooling, reducing upward pressure on yields.
- **2025-06-20** ↑ — Strong economic data suggests robust growth, potentially increasing yields.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Federal Reserve Policy**: Large impact; rate hikes/cuts directly influence yields.
- **Inflation Expectations**: Moderate impact; higher inflation typically leads to higher yields.
- **Economic Growth**: Moderate impact; strong growth can push yields up.
- **Global Economic Conditions**: Small to moderate impact; international demand for U.S. Treasuries affects yields.
- **Regulatory Changes**: Small impact; can influence market stability and liquidity.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Current Fed Stance**: Potential rate cuts are more prominent now compared to past periods.
- **Inflation Trends**: Recent cooling of inflation is a shift from the high rates seen in 2022-2023.
- **Market Volatility**: Increased volatility due to geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties.
- **Regulatory Environment**: Recent changes aimed at enhancing market stability.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a prior centered around 4% with moderate strength (equivalent n = 20).
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Fed rate cut signals (moderate)
  - ↓ Cooling inflation data (moderate)
  - ↑ Strong economic growth indicators (small)
- **Net effect**: Posterior should slightly move down due to cooling inflation and potential rate cuts.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Stronger-than-expected economic data.
  - Hawkish Fed statements.
  - Rising inflation expectations.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Fed rate cut announcements.
  - Continued cooling in inflation data.
  - Weakening global economic conditions.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Data Revisions**: Economic data is subject to revisions, impacting yield forecasts.
- **Geopolitical Risks**: Unforeseen events can cause sudden market shifts.
- **Policy Uncertainty**: Changes in Fed leadership or policy direction can alter expectations.
- **Market Sentiment**: Investor behavior can be unpredictable, affecting yields.

Final Research Summary: The UST 10Y Yield is likely to be influenced by potential Fed rate cuts and cooling inflation, suggesting a slight downward adjustment from current levels. However, strong economic data and geopolitical risks could counteract this trend.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the ending value of the UST 10Y Yield for the biweekly period from September 29 to October 10, let's follow the structured approach:
    
    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - **Historical UST 10Y Yield**: The yield has ranged from approximately 0.5% to 3.5% over the past decade, with recent fluctuations between 1.5% and 4.5% due to post-COVID economic recovery and inflation concerns.
       - **Chosen Base Rate**: A prior centered around 4% with moderate variance, reflecting recent yield levels and economic conditions.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - **Similarities**: The current economic environment still reflects post-COVID recovery dynamics and inflation concerns, similar to recent years.
       - **Differences**: Potential Fed rate cuts and cooling inflation are more prominent now, suggesting a possible downward shift in yields.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - **Fed Rate Cut Signals**: Suggests a downward pressure on yields (moderate impact).
       - **Cooling Inflation Data**: Also suggests downward pressure (moderate impact).
       - **Strong Economic Growth Indicators**: Could exert upward pressure, but less significant compared to the other factors (small impact).
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - **Prior**: Centered around 4%.
       - **Evidence**: Cooling inflation and potential rate cuts suggest a downward adjustment.
       - **Posterior**: Slightly lower than the prior, reflecting the net effect of the evidence.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - **Overconfidence Check**: Consider geopolitical risks and unexpected economic data revisions that could shift yields.
       - **Alternative Scenario**: If economic data is stronger than expected, yields could remain stable or increase.
       - **Adjustment**: Account for these risks by slightly widening the distribution.
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Given the evidence and potential risks, the forecasted percentiles are adjusted to reflect a slight downward shift with consideration for tail risks.
