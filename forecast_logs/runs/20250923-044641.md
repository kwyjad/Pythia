## Research (summary)

CALIBRATION GUIDANCE (auto-generated weekly):
BINARY CALIBRATION
- No resolved binary questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.
- Advice: keep using base rates + small evidence-weighted updates; avoid big swings.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE CALIBRATION (Top-1)
- No resolved MCQ questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.

NUMERIC CALIBRATION (PIT-lite + CRPS)
- No resolved numeric questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.
- When numeric results exist, we’ll check p10/p50/p90 coverage and CRPS.

General takeaway: apply **small** nudges only where gaps are consistent with decent sample sizes (≥10).

### Reference class & base rates
- **RCTs on health interventions in low-income countries**: Typically, 50-70% show statistically significant results. Limitations include variability in implementation and local context.
- **Studies on ORS/zinc interventions**: Historically, 60-80% show increased usage, but context-specific factors can heavily influence outcomes.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2024-05-01] ↑ — GiveWell grant to Wageningen University for RCT in Sierra Leone, enhancing study scope.
- [2025-09-01] ↑ — Preliminary reports suggest high community engagement in health interventions.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Community engagement**: Large — High engagement can significantly boost intervention uptake.
- **Health education**: Moderate — Effective communication of benefits can increase usage.
- **Perceived substitutes**: Moderate — Viewing ORS/zinc and chlorine as substitutes may reduce usage.
- **Access to health services**: Large — Increased access can drive higher adoption rates.
- **Cultural acceptance**: Moderate — Cultural norms may influence acceptance and usage.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Comprehensive intervention bundle**: More services offered than typical, potentially overwhelming recipients.
- **Remote community focus**: Less exposure to health systems may alter response compared to more urban settings.
- **Two-round distribution**: Allows for reinforcement of health messages, unlike single-round studies.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: 70% chance of significant increase (GiveWell's internal forecast); equivalent n = moderate.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Large — High community engagement reported.
  - ↑ Moderate — Two-round distribution allows for message reinforcement.
  - ↓ Moderate — Potential confusion due to comprehensive service bundle.
  - ↓ Small — Perceived substitutes may reduce ORS/zinc usage.
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move slightly up, given strong community engagement and two-round reinforcement.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Increased community health meetings.
  - Positive feedback from initial surveys.
  - High attendance in follow-up visits.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Reports of confusion or overwhelm among recipients.
  - Low uptake of chlorine, indicating substitution effect.
  - Delays in follow-up visit schedules.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Data reliability**: Self-reported usage may be biased.
- **Cultural barriers**: Unanticipated cultural resistance could skew results.
- **Implementation fidelity**: Variability in how interventions are delivered.
- **Definitional clarity**: Ensure clear criteria for "statistically significant increase."

Final Research Summary: The study in Sierra Leone is likely to find a statistically significant increase in ORS/zinc usage, driven by strong community engagement and a two-round intervention strategy, though potential confusion from the comprehensive service bundle remains a risk.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the probability of the study finding a statistically significant increase in ORS/zinc usage, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:
    
    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for RCTs on health interventions in low-income countries showing statistically significant results is typically between 50-70%. For ORS/zinc interventions specifically, the historical success rate is 60-80%. Given GiveWell's internal forecast of a 70% chance, we will use this as our prior probability, as it aligns with both the general and specific historical data.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The study is a well-funded RCT in a low-income country, similar to the reference class.
       - Differences: The intervention includes a comprehensive bundle of services, which could overwhelm recipients, and the study is conducted in remote communities with less exposure to health systems, potentially affecting outcomes.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - High community engagement (↑): Likely if the event occurs, less likely if it does not. This increases the probability.
       - Two-round distribution (↑): Reinforces health messages, increasing the likelihood of significant results.
       - Comprehensive service bundle (↓): Could overwhelm recipients, decreasing the likelihood.
       - Perceived substitutes (↓): May reduce ORS/zinc usage, decreasing the likelihood.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds = 70% / 30% = 2.33
       - Likelihood ratio: Considering the evidence, the positive factors (community engagement, two-round distribution) are strong, while the negative factors (service bundle, substitutes) are moderate. Overall, the likelihood ratio is slightly greater than 1.
       - Posterior odds = 2.33 × Likelihood ratio (slightly > 1) ≈ 2.5
       - Posterior probability = 2.5 / (1 + 2.5) ≈ 71.4%
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might be too optimistic given potential cultural barriers and data reliability issues.
       - Alternative scenario: If cultural resistance is stronger than anticipated, the probability could be lower.
       - Adjustments: Consider a slight downward adjustment to account for these risks.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - After considering the evidence and potential risks, the final forecast is slightly adjusted to reflect a balanced view of the positive and negative factors.
    
    Final: 70%
