### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical Performance of IBEX 35**: Historically, the IBEX 35 has shown an average annual growth rate of around 5-7% over the past two decades, with significant volatility.
- **European Stock Indices**: Other major European indices like the DAX and CAC 40 have similar growth rates, but with different sectoral compositions.
- **Limitations**: Economic conditions, political stability, and sectoral shifts can significantly alter these base rates.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- **2025-09-01** ↑ — Spain's GDP growth forecast revised upwards, boosting investor confidence.
- **2025-08-15** ↓ — ECB hints at potential interest rate hikes, which could dampen stock market enthusiasm.
- **2025-07-20** ↑ — Strong earnings reports from major IBEX 35 constituents, indicating robust corporate health.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Economic Growth**: Moderate impact; stronger GDP growth can boost market performance.
- **Monetary Policy**: Large impact; ECB interest rate decisions can significantly influence market trends.
- **Corporate Earnings**: Moderate impact; positive earnings reports can drive stock prices up.
- **Political Stability**: Small impact; political events can create short-term volatility.
- **Global Market Trends**: Large impact; global economic conditions and investor sentiment can sway the index.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Recent Strong Performance**: The IBEX 35 has outperformed its historical average recently, suggesting potential overvaluation.
- **Interest Rate Environment**: Current low rates are atypical and may change, affecting future growth.
- **Sectoral Shifts**: Increased tech and renewable energy representation in the index, differing from historical composition.
- **Geopolitical Tensions**: Heightened global tensions could introduce more volatility than usual.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a moderate growth expectation based on historical averages (equivalent n = 20 years).
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Strong GDP growth forecast (moderate).
  - ↓ Potential ECB rate hikes (large).
  - ↑ Positive corporate earnings (moderate).
- **Net effect**: The posterior should slightly favor a positive outcome, but with caution due to potential rate hikes.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Continued GDP growth revisions upwards.
  - Sustained positive earnings reports.
  - ECB maintaining current interest rates.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - ECB signaling or implementing rate hikes.
  - Negative geopolitical developments.
  - Decline in consumer confidence indices.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Economic Forecast Uncertainty**: GDP forecasts can be revised unpredictably.
- **Interest Rate Sensitivity**: Markets may react sharply to ECB policy changes.
- **Sectoral Volatility**: Tech and renewable sectors can be more volatile.
- **Data Gaps**: Limited real-time data on some economic indicators.
- **Regime Changes**: Sudden political shifts could alter market dynamics.

Final Research Summary: The IBEX 35 is likely to close 2025 higher than it started, given strong economic growth and corporate earnings, but potential ECB rate hikes pose a significant risk. Forecasters should monitor economic indicators and ECB policy closely.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast whether the IBEX 35 will close 2025 higher than it started, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Historical Performance of IBEX 35**: The IBEX 35 has historically shown an average annual growth rate of around 5-7%. Given the recent strong performance in 2023 and 2024, a reasonable base rate for the index closing higher than it started is around 60-70%, reflecting both historical growth and recent momentum.
    - **Initial Prior**: Let's set the initial prior probability at 65%, reflecting the historical growth rate and recent strong performance.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarities**: The current situation is similar to the historical base case in terms of economic growth and corporate earnings, which have been strong.
    - **Differences**: The potential for ECB interest rate hikes is a significant deviation from the base case, as low rates have been a key driver of recent growth. Additionally, the current geopolitical tensions and sectoral shifts towards tech and renewables introduce more volatility.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **Strong GDP Growth Forecast**: This is moderately likely if the index closes higher (P(E | H) = 0.7) and less likely if it does not (P(E | ~H) = 0.4). Likelihood ratio = 0.7 / 0.4 = 1.75. This increases the probability.
    - **Potential ECB Rate Hikes**: This is less likely if the index closes higher (P(E | H) = 0.3) and more likely if it does not (P(E | ~H) = 0.6). Likelihood ratio = 0.3 / 0.6 = 0.5. This decreases the probability.
    - **Positive Corporate Earnings**: This is moderately likely if the index closes higher (P(E | H) = 0.6) and less likely if it does not (P(E | ~H) = 0.4). Likelihood ratio = 0.6 / 0.4 = 1.5. This increases the probability.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    - **Prior Odds**: 65% probability translates to odds of 0.65 / 0.35 = 1.857.
    - **Likelihood Ratios**: Combined likelihood ratio = 1.75 * 0.5 * 1.5 = 1.3125.
    - **Posterior Odds**: 1.857 * 1.3125 = 2.437.
    - **Posterior Probability**: 2.437 / (1 + 2.437) ≈ 0.709 or 70.9%.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: The forecast might be overconfident given the potential for ECB rate hikes, which could have a large impact.
    - **Tail Risks**: Consider the possibility of unexpected geopolitical events or drastic changes in ECB policy.
    - **Alternative Forecast**: A more conservative forecast might place more weight on the potential for rate hikes, suggesting a probability closer to 60%.
    
    ### 6. Final Forecast
    - Adjusting for potential overconfidence and tail risks, a balanced forecast would slightly lower the probability to account for these factors.
    
    Final: 68%
