### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical US CPI Changes**: Over the past 20 years, the average annual CPI change has been around 2-3%. However, recent years have seen more volatility.
- **Post-Election Economic Adjustments**: Historically, new administrations can influence inflation through policy changes, with effects typically seen within 1-2 years.
- **Global Economic Trends**: Global inflation rates can impact US inflation, with recent global rates averaging around 3-4%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-08-19] item — direction (↓) — Inflation is up, but economic resilience suggests potential stabilization.
- [2024-09-17] item — direction (↑) — Inflation hit a three-year low, indicating potential for continued decrease.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Monetary Policy**: Large — Interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve can significantly impact inflation.
- **Fiscal Policy**: Moderate — Government spending and tax policies can influence inflationary pressures.
- **Global Supply Chains**: Moderate — Disruptions or improvements can affect import prices and inflation.
- **Labor Market Dynamics**: Moderate — Wage growth and employment rates can drive inflation up or down.
- **Tariffs and Trade Policies**: Moderate — Changes in tariffs can directly impact consumer prices.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Political Influence**: Trump's active role in influencing the Fed is atypical and could lead to unpredictable inflation outcomes.
- **Tariff Policies**: Increased tariffs under Trump could lead to higher inflation compared to historical norms.
- **Labor Market Tightness**: Current labor market conditions are tighter than usual, potentially driving inflation.
- **Global Economic Conditions**: Current global economic uncertainties may lead to atypical inflation trends.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a prior based on historical CPI changes with an equivalent n of 20 years.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Moderate: Trump's influence on the Fed and potential for unconventional policies.
  - ↓ Moderate: Recent low inflation rates and potential stabilization.
  - ↑ Small: Tariff policies potentially increasing inflation.
  - ↓ Small: Global economic conditions potentially stabilizing inflation.
- **Net effect**: The posterior should slightly favor a decrease in inflation, given recent trends and potential stabilization.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Increased tariffs or trade tensions.
  - Rising wage growth rates.
  - Expansionary fiscal policies.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.
  - Decreased consumer spending.
  - Improved global supply chain conditions.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Uncertainty in Policy Implementation**: Trump's policies may not be fully implemented or have delayed effects.
- **Data Gaps**: Incomplete or delayed economic data can obscure trends.
- **Global Economic Shocks**: Unforeseen global events could disrupt inflation predictions.
- **Definitional Changes**: Changes in CPI calculation methods could affect comparability.

Final Research Summary: Recent trends suggest a potential decrease in inflation by November 2025, but Trump's unconventional policies and global uncertainties introduce significant variability. Forecasters should monitor policy changes and economic indicators closely.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast whether the 12-month percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be lower in November 2025 than it was in November 2024, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Historical US CPI Changes**: Historically, the average annual CPI change has been around 2-3%. However, recent volatility suggests a wider range.
    - **Base Rate Selection**: Given the historical average and recent volatility, a reasonable prior probability that inflation will decrease year-over-year is around 50%. This reflects the uncertainty and variability in recent inflation trends.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarities**: The current situation involves typical post-election economic adjustments and global economic influences, similar to past periods.
    - **Differences**: Trump's active role in influencing the Fed and increased tariffs are atypical and could lead to unpredictable inflation outcomes. These factors introduce more uncertainty compared to the historical base case.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **Trump's Influence on the Fed**: This could lead to unconventional monetary policies, potentially increasing inflation. Likelihood ratio slightly favors inflation not decreasing.
    - **Recent Low Inflation Rates**: Inflation hit a three-year low, suggesting potential stabilization. Likelihood ratio favors inflation decreasing.
    - **Tariff Policies**: Increased tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices, slightly favoring inflation not decreasing.
    - **Global Economic Conditions**: Potential stabilization of global conditions could help decrease inflation. Likelihood ratio favors inflation decreasing.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    - **Prior Odds**: 1:1 (50% probability)
    - **Evidence Impact**:
      - Trump's influence and tariffs slightly increase the odds of inflation not decreasing.
      - Recent low inflation rates and potential global stabilization slightly increase the odds of inflation decreasing.
    - **Net Effect**: The evidence slightly favors a decrease in inflation, given recent trends and potential stabilization.
    - **Posterior Probability Calculation**: Adjusting the prior based on the evidence, the probability of inflation being lower in November 2025 than in November 2024 is slightly above 50%.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: The forecast should account for the significant uncertainty introduced by Trump's policies and global economic conditions.
    - **Alternative Scenarios**: Consider the possibility of unexpected global economic shocks or policy changes that could drastically alter inflation trends.
    - **Adjustment**: Given these considerations, the probability should be adjusted to reflect the inherent uncertainty and potential for unexpected developments.
    
    ### 6. Final Forecast
    - **Final Probability**: Considering the base rate, evidence, and uncertainty, the final forecast probability is 55%.
    
    Final: 55%
