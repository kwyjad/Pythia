### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Intense Civil Wars with Fragmented Sovereignty:** Conflicts where a state has lost its monopoly on violence and is challenged by a well-armed, territorially-controlling non-state actor (e.g., Syria, Yemen, Libya). In these cases, direct, in-person talks are rare in the initial years. A "mutually hurting stalemate" is often a prerequisite. The base rate for opposing leaderships meeting physically for substantive talks within the first three years of such a conflict is low, estimated at **15-25%**. This is derived from observing the protracted nature of similar conflicts where talks are often indirect, repeatedly collapse, or are boycotted for years.
2.  **Conflicts Between Former Military Allies/Coup Leaders:** Wars that erupt from power struggles within a ruling military junta (e.g., various historical coups in Africa and Latin America). These conflicts are often highly personalized and zero-sum, as each leader views the other as a direct, existential threat to their legitimacy and survival. The path to negotiation is often blocked by personal animosity and demands for surrender or exile. The base rate for direct, in-person talks before a decisive military outcome is very low, estimated at **10-20%**.
3.  **Externally-Sponsored Peace Processes for African Civil Wars:** Mediation efforts led by regional (AU, IGAD) and international (UN, US, Saudi Arabia) bodies. While these bodies frequently convene talks, securing the physical attendance of both primary belligerents is a significant, often unmet, milestone. A review of recent efforts (e.g., South Sudan, Ethiopia) suggests a higher rate of convening talks, but often with low-level delegations or with one party boycotting. The base rate for getting both main faction leaders or their top deputies in the same room within a year of a major mediation push is perhaps **30-40%**, but this is often preceded by years of fighting.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-30** The war enters its third year with the RSF besieging el-Fasher and the SAF making limited gains elsewhere. — **↓** — Indicates a grinding, non-decisive military situation, not a stalemate conducive to talks. Both sides still appear to believe in a military solution.
*   **2025-08-XX** (Implied by background) One year since the Geneva talks where the SAF was a no-show. — **↓** — Reinforces a pattern of one or both parties avoiding direct, physical engagement, setting a precedent of failure for this format.
*   **2024-11-18** Russia vetoes a UN Security Council ceasefire resolution. — **↓** — Demonstrates a fractured international consensus, reducing unified pressure on the warring parties and allowing them to rely on their respective international backers, thus disincentivizing compromise.
*   **2024-06-13** UNSC Resolution 2736 calls for a ceasefire and dialogue. — **↑ (small)** — Represents sustained, high-level international attention on the conflict, which creates a persistent, albeit weak, diplomatic pressure for talks.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Military Stalemate:** A "mutually hurting stalemate" where both sides conclude they cannot win militarily is the most powerful driver for genuine negotiations. The current situation appears to be a war of attrition, not a recognized stalemate, reducing the incentive to talk. (Large impact)
2.  **Coherent International Pressure:** Unified and sustained pressure from key external patrons (UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, US, Russia) and international bodies (UN, AU) could compel the parties to the table. However, competing interests among these actors have so far undermined this pressure. (Large impact)
3.  **Humanitarian Catastrophe:** The extreme scale of displacement and famine could theoretically pressure leaders to negotiate for legitimacy and to enable aid. In practice, parties often weaponize aid and are insulated from the suffering, blunting this mechanism. (Moderate impact)
4.  **Internal Factional Weakness:** Significant defections, loss of financial resources, or the death/incapacitation of a key leader (Burhan or Hemedti) could force a faction to the negotiating table out of weakness. There is currently no strong public evidence of this. (Large impact)
5.  **Shift in External Backers' Strategy:** A decision by a key patron (e.g., the UAE for the RSF, Egypt for the SAF) to withdraw or significantly reduce support would dramatically alter a party's calculations and could force them to negotiate. (Large impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Personal Animosity:** Unlike more ideological civil wars, this conflict is rooted in a direct power struggle between two generals, Burhan and Hemedti, who were once allies. This personal betrayal makes trust and direct engagement exceptionally difficult.
*   **Viable Non-State Actor:** The RSF is not a typical rebel group. It is a powerful, wealthy paramilitary force with control over significant economic assets (e.g., gold mines) and extensive international backing, giving it the means to sustain a long war without controlling the state apparatus.
*   **Competing Regional Patrons:** The conflict is heavily internationalized, with Egypt and Iran backing the SAF and the UAE backing the RSF. This proxy-war dynamic entrenches the belligerents and makes them less susceptible to unified international pressure compared to a more isolated conflict.
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The question resolves by Dec 31, 2025. With the current date at Oct 5, 2025, there are less than three months remaining. The logistical and political momentum required to convene such a high-stakes meeting in this timeframe is immense, especially given the lack of any preparatory progress.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from a reference class of intractable civil wars, a base rate of ~20% for direct talks occurring within a three-year period seems reasonable. Let's consider this a weak prior (equivalent n of ~5).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The extremely short time horizon (<3 months) is the single most powerful piece of evidence against resolution. Diplomatic breakthroughs of this magnitude are rarely so swift.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The established pattern of failed talks (Geneva no-show, Jeddah collapse) and the continued pursuit of military objectives (el-Fasher siege) indicate no change in the parties' fundamental calculations.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The divided international landscape (e.g., Russian veto) provides diplomatic cover for the parties to avoid serious negotiations.
    *   **↑ (Small):** The sheer scale of the humanitarian crisis creates some background pressure and a constant diplomatic pretext for convening talks, even if they are unlikely to succeed.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points downward. The posterior probability should be revised significantly lower than the initial prior, primarily due to the severe time constraint.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A sudden, decisive, and lasting ceasefire around a major city like El Fasher.
    *   Joint statement from the US, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Egypt issuing a unified ultimatum for talks.
    *   Credible reports of secret, high-level back-channel communications between the SAF and RSF.
    *   Appointment of a new, high-profile international envoy with the explicit backing of both sides' key patrons.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Launch of a major new offensive by either side.
    *   Public statements from Burhan or Hemedti reiterating preconditions for talks (e.g., RSF withdrawal from cities).
    *   Another international mediation attempt is announced but one party immediately signals it will not attend.
    *   Further evidence of deepening military support from external patrons to their respective proxies.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution requires physical presence. A last-minute, low-level, purely symbolic "technical" meeting could be arranged for PR purposes to appease international actors, which would trigger a YES resolution despite no substantive progress.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Reporting from Sudan is extremely difficult. A breakthrough in secret talks could occur with little public warning, leading to a sudden meeting.
*   **Deception Risk:** Either side might agree to attend a meeting with no intention of negotiating seriously, simply to shift blame for the conflict's continuation onto the other party.
*   **"Black Swan" Event:** The sudden death or removal of Burhan or Hemedti would be a game-changer, the direction of which is unpredictable. It could either collapse one side, leading to a military end, or open the door for new leadership to negotiate.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability is very low. The extremely short timeframe of less than three months, combined with a consistent history of failed direct talks and an ongoing military logic from both sides, creates formidable barriers that are unlikely to be overcome by the deadline.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for direct, in-person talks occurring within the first three years of intense civil wars with fragmented sovereignty is estimated at 15-25%. Given the context of the Sudan conflict, where the SAF and RSF have not engaged in meaningful face-to-face negotiations, a base rate of 20% seems reasonable. This reflects the historical difficulty of convening such talks in similar conflicts.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The conflict in Sudan is characterized by intense civil war dynamics, with both sides entrenched in a military struggle and significant international involvement, similar to other conflicts in the reference class.
   - Differences: The extreme personal animosity between the leaders, the short time horizon, and the ongoing military engagements make the situation more challenging than typical cases. These factors suggest a lower likelihood of talks occurring within the given timeframe.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Short Time Horizon:** The likelihood of organizing a high-stakes meeting within less than three months is very low. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.
   - **Pattern of Failed Talks:** The history of failed negotiations, such as the Geneva and Jeddah talks, indicates a persistent avoidance of direct engagement. This evidence decreases the probability.
   - **Divided International Landscape:** The lack of a unified international front, exemplified by Russia's veto, reduces diplomatic pressure for talks. This evidence decreases the probability.
   - **Humanitarian Crisis:** While the crisis creates some pressure for talks, it has not yet led to significant diplomatic breakthroughs. This evidence slightly increases the probability but is outweighed by other factors.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 20% probability = 0.25 odds
   - Likelihood ratio: The combined evidence suggests a strong downward adjustment. Assuming a likelihood ratio of 0.1 (reflecting the low probability of talks given the evidence), the posterior odds are 0.25 × 0.1 = 0.025.
   - Posterior probability: 0.025 / (1 + 0.025) ≈ 2.44%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Risk: The analysis might underestimate the potential for a last-minute diplomatic push or secret negotiations. However, the short timeframe and lack of indicators for such developments justify the low probability.
   - Alternative Scenario: A sudden shift in external backers' strategies or a major internal factional change could alter the dynamics. These scenarios are currently unlikely but should be monitored.
   - Adjustments: Given the overwhelming evidence against a resolution, the probability remains low.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final forecast reflects a very low probability of both SAF and RSF delegations attending the same peace negotiation venue before December 31, 2025.

Final: 2%

# Will SAF and RSF delegations both physically attend the same peace negotiation venue before December 31, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to select an appropriate base rate for the likelihood of warring factions in a civil conflict physically attending the same peace negotiation venue within a specific timeframe.

Based on the research report, I'll use a combination of the reference classes provided:
- Intense civil wars with fragmented sovereignty: 15-25% chance of direct talks within 3 years
- Conflicts between former military allies/coup leaders: 10-20% chance of direct talks before decisive military outcome
- Externally-sponsored peace processes for African civil wars: 30-40% chance of getting both factions in the same room within a year of mediation

Given that this conflict combines elements of all three reference classes, and considering that the war has been ongoing since April 2023 (about 2.5 years), I'll use a base rate of approximately 20%. This represents a reasonable middle ground between the different reference classes while acknowledging the specific dynamics of this conflict.

**Prior probability: 20%** (or odds of 1:4)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is an intense civil war with fragmented sovereignty where a state has lost its monopoly on violence
- The conflict involves former military allies (Burhan and Hemedti) in a power struggle
- There are external mediation efforts by regional and international bodies (AU, IGAD, Saudi Arabia, US)
- The conflict has created a severe humanitarian crisis, which typically increases pressure for negotiations

**Key differences:**
- **Extremely short timeframe**: With today being October 5, 2025, there are less than 3 months until the December 31, 2025 deadline. This is significantly shorter than the typical timeframes in the reference classes.
- **Established pattern of failed talks**: Previous attempts (Geneva, Jeddah) have already failed, with one or both parties refusing to physically attend.
- **Extreme personal animosity**: The conflict is rooted in a direct power struggle between two former allies, creating unusually high levels of distrust.
- **Internationalized conflict**: The involvement of competing regional powers (UAE, Egypt, Iran) makes the parties less susceptible to unified international pressure.
- **No mutually hurting stalemate**: The conflict appears to be in a war of attrition phase rather than a recognized stalemate, reducing incentives to negotiate.

These differences, particularly the extremely short timeframe and established pattern of failed talks, suggest a significantly lower probability than the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Extremely short timeframe (less than 3 months)**
- P(E|H): If both delegations will attend the same venue, how likely is it that we'd observe this short timeframe? Very unlikely. Peace negotiations typically require months of preparation, especially after failed attempts.
- P(E|~H): If they won't attend, how likely is this short timeframe? Very likely, as there's insufficient time to overcome the significant barriers.
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H)/P(E|~H) ≈ 0.2 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 2: Pattern of failed talks (Geneva, Jeddah)**
- P(E|H): If both delegations will attend, how likely is it that we'd observe this pattern of failed talks? Somewhat unlikely, as successful negotiations often build on incremental progress.
- P(E|~H): If they won't attend, how likely is this pattern? Very likely, as it establishes a precedent of avoidance.
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H)/P(E|~H) ≈ 0.4 (moderate evidence against)

**Evidence 3: Ongoing military operations (RSF besieging el-Fasher, SAF making limited gains)**
- P(E|H): If both delegations will attend, how likely is it that we'd observe ongoing military operations? Somewhat unlikely, as negotiations typically follow de-escalation.
- P(E|~H): If they won't attend, how likely is this pattern? Very likely, as it indicates both sides still believe in military solutions.
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H)/P(E|~H) ≈ 0.5 (moderate evidence against)

**Evidence 4: Divided international landscape (Russian veto of UN resolution)**
- P(E|H): If both delegations will attend, how likely is it that we'd observe international division? Somewhat unlikely, as unified pressure is typically needed.
- P(E|~H): If they won't attend, how likely is this division? Likely, as it provides diplomatic cover to avoid negotiations.
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H)/P(E|~H) ≈ 0.6 (weak evidence against)

**Evidence 5: Severe humanitarian crisis**
- P(E|H): If both delegations will attend, how likely is it that we'd observe this humanitarian crisis? Likely, as it creates pressure for talks.
- P(E|~H): If they won't attend, how likely is this crisis? Also likely, as parties often ignore humanitarian concerns.
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H)/P(E|~H) ≈ 1.1 (very weak evidence for)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1:4 (20% probability), I'll update based on the evidence:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Product of likelihood ratios
Posterior odds = (1/4) × 0.2 × 0.4 × 0.5 × 0.6 × 1.1
Posterior odds = (1/4) × 0.0264
Posterior odds ≈ 0.0066 or about 1:151

Converting to probability:
Posterior probability = Posterior odds / (1 + Posterior odds)
Posterior probability = 0.0066 / (1 + 0.0066)
Posterior probability ≈ 0.0066 or about 0.7%

This extremely low probability seems too aggressive given the uncertainties involved. Let me reconsider the strength of the evidence and potential mitigating factors.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots in my analysis:**

1. **Secret back-channel communications**: There could be ongoing secret talks that aren't publicly known. Peace processes often involve confidential preliminary discussions.

2. **Pressure from external patrons**: A sudden shift in the position of key backers (UAE, Egypt) could force the parties to negotiate, even reluctantly.

3. **Definitional considerations**: The question only requires delegations to be physically present, not the faction leaders themselves. Lower-level delegations might be easier to convene.

4. **International pressure escalation**: The humanitarian catastrophe could trigger unprecedented unified international pressure.

5. **Overweighting the timeframe**: While the short timeframe is a significant constraint, diplomatic breakthroughs can happen quickly when conditions align.

Given these considerations, my initial update was likely too aggressive. The extremely short timeframe remains a major constraint, but the other factors deserve more moderate weighting.

**Alternative forecast and rebuttal:**

An alternative forecast might argue for a 10-15% probability, citing:
- The humanitarian crisis is so severe that international pressure will become overwhelming
- Technical delegations (not faction leaders) could meet for symbolic reasons
- Secret talks might already be underway

Rebuttal: While these factors are plausible, they don't overcome the fundamental issues of the extremely short timeframe, the ongoing military operations indicating both sides still believe in military solutions, and the established pattern of failed talks. The personal animosity between leaders and competing international backers further complicate prospects.

## 6. Final Forecast

Reconsidering my analysis, I believe my initial Bayesian update was too aggressive. The short timeframe and other negative factors do significantly reduce the probability below the base rate, but not to the extreme degree I initially calculated.

Given the short timeframe (less than 3 months), the pattern of failed talks, ongoing military operations, and divided international landscape, balanced against the possibility of secret talks and the pressure from the humanitarian crisis, I assess the probability at 8%.

This reflects a significant reduction from the base rate of 20%, primarily due to the extremely short timeframe and established pattern of failed negotiations, while acknowledging that unexpected diplomatic breakthroughs remain possible.

Final: 8%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a direct, in-person peace negotiation between the primary belligerents in a civil war. I will use a combination of two reference classes provided in the research report:
1.  **Intense Civil Wars with Fragmented Sovereignty:** These conflicts (e.g., Syria, Yemen) have a low base rate for direct, in-person talks between top leaderships within the first three years, estimated at 15-25%.
2.  **Conflicts Between Former Military Allies:** These conflicts are highly personalized and zero-sum, making trust and negotiation exceptionally difficult before a decisive military outcome. The base rate is estimated at 10-20%.

The conflict in Sudan fits both descriptions perfectly. It is an intense civil war, and it stems from a personal power struggle between former allies, Generals Burhan and Hemedti. Averaging these two reference classes gives a reasonable starting point. I will select a prior probability of **20%** for such talks occurring within a three-year window from the conflict's start.
*   **Prior P(H) = 20%** (or 1:4 odds).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:** The conflict's structure—a state army versus a powerful, well-funded paramilitary force with significant external backing—is typical of modern, intractable civil wars. The personalized nature of the conflict also aligns with the second reference class.

**Differences:** The most significant difference is the **time horizon**. The base rate is for an event occurring anytime within a three-year period. The conflict began in April 2023. The question asks if the event will occur before December 31, 2025. As of today (October 5, 2025), over 2.5 years have passed *without* such a meeting. We are forecasting for a very short window of less than three months at the tail end of this period. The probability of an event occurring in a small remaining timeframe, given it hasn't occurred in the large preceding timeframe, is substantially lower than the initial base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that SAF and RSF delegations meet physically before the deadline.

*   **Evidence 1: Extremely Short Time Horizon (< 3 months).**
    *   P(E | H): For a meeting to happen, it must be organized within this short window. While possible, diplomatic breakthroughs of this kind usually require extensive groundwork, which is not apparent. The likelihood is low.
    *   P(E | ~H): If no meeting happens, observing the clock run out is the default outcome. The likelihood is very high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1.** This is the single most powerful piece of evidence and it **massively decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Consistent Failure/Avoidance of Direct Talks.** The SAF did not physically attend the Geneva talks in August 2024, and the Jeddah talks in 2023 collapsed.
    *   P(E | H): A future meeting would have to occur *despite* this established pattern of avoidance, implying a major shift in incentives.
    *   P(E | ~H): This pattern of failure is perfectly consistent with no meeting occurring.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio < 1.** This evidence **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Ongoing Military Offensives.** The RSF continues its siege of el-Fasher, and the SAF is conducting its own operations.
    *   P(E | H): Substantive talks are almost always preceded by a ceasefire or a recognized stalemate. Active pursuit of military objectives is highly inconsistent with an imminent peace meeting.
    *   P(E | ~H): Ongoing fighting is the expected state of affairs if the war continues without negotiations.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1.** This evidence **strongly decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 4: Fractured International Pressure.** The Russian veto of a UNSC resolution and the competing interests of regional patrons (UAE backing RSF, Egypt backing SAF) undermine the unified pressure needed to compel the parties to negotiate.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio < 1.** This **decreases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
My initial prior of 20% was for a 3-year (36-month) period. The fact that no meeting has occurred in the first ~33.5 months is powerful evidence.

*   **Initial Prior Odds:** 1:4 (20% probability).
*   **Update for Time Elapsed:** The failure of talks to materialize for over 90% of the reference period makes it highly unlikely they will occur in the final <10%. This alone would reduce the odds by at least an order of magnitude. Let's apply a conservative 10x reduction factor.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (1:4) / 10 = 1:40 (or ~2.4% probability).
*   **Update for Other Evidence:** The ongoing fighting, history of boycotts, and divided international pressure all further reduce the likelihood. Cumulatively, these factors might reduce the odds by another factor of 3-4.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (1:40) / 3.5 = 1:140 (or ~0.7% probability).

This calculation suggests a probability of less than 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis points to a very low probability. What could I be missing?
*   **The "PR Stunt" Scenario:** The resolution criteria are broad: "any official delegation level qualifies." A key mediator like Saudi Arabia or the US could push for a low-level, purely symbolic meeting before the end of the year to claim a diplomatic "win." The parties might agree to this to curry favor or shift blame, even with no intention of negotiating in good faith. This is the most plausible path to a YES resolution.
*   **Black Swan Event:** The sudden death or ousting of Burhan or Hemedti could dramatically alter the situation, potentially forcing the weakened side to the table.
*   **Secret Breakthrough:** We have limited visibility into any back-channel talks. A deal could be closer than it appears publicly.

The "PR stunt" scenario is the most significant counterargument. The incentive for mediators to produce a visible result is real. This possibility means the final probability should be higher than the sub-1% derived from a strict analysis of substantive negotiation likelihoods. I will assign a few percentage points to account for this possibility. A 3% forecast implies that in about 1 out of 33 similar situations, some form of last-minute, low-bar meeting would materialize, which feels plausible.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for such talks is already low. The fact that we are in the final few months of a multi-year period without any progress makes the probability extremely small. The active military situation and history of failed talks reinforce this conclusion. The only significant possibility for a "YES" resolution comes from a low-level, symbolic meeting arranged for public relations, not substantive peace. This small possibility prevents the forecast from being near-zero.

Final: 3%
