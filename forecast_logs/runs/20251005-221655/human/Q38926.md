### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) of free point-of-use (POU) water treatment products in Sub-Saharan Africa.** Studies consistently show that removing cost and access barriers via free, convenient delivery dramatically increases uptake compared to social marketing or cost-sharing models. A meta-analysis of water treatment interventions found that free provision and promotion led to substantial increases in use. **Base Rate (for finding a statistically significant positive effect): 70-85%.** This is high because the interventions are known to be effective; the main question is the magnitude of the effect and the study's power to detect it.
-   **Reference Class 2: GiveWell-funded RCTs for well-understood, high-impact interventions.** GiveWell typically funds studies where there is a strong prior for effectiveness, often to measure the effect size in a new context or with a new delivery model. These studies are generally well-designed and adequately powered. The failure rate for finding a significant effect is likely low, as they are not typically funding highly speculative interventions. **Base Rate (for finding a statistically significant effect): 75-90%.**
-   **Limitations:** The key uncertainty is not *if* there will be an effect, but if the effect will be >5 percentage points. The bundling of multiple health interventions in this specific study is a significant deviation from many single-focus studies in the reference class, introducing a novel failure mode (information overload).

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2024-09-25] Sierra Leone launches 'Feed Salone' programme — (↑ small) — Indicates a stable government focus on development and international partnerships, suggesting a favorable operating environment for the research team. Not directly related to health, but reduces risk of systemic disruption.
-   [2024-05-23] GiveWell announces the grant to Wageningen University — (neutral) — This is the event that initiated the question. The grant page contains all key public information, including GiveWell's own 80% forecast, which serves as a strong anchor.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Free & Convenient Delivery (large ↑):** The intervention removes the two largest barriers to adoption: cost and access. Door-to-door delivery by a health team is a very strong push mechanism, proven effective in numerous prior studies.
-   **Bundling & Information Overload (large ↓):** Chlorine is one of at least five distinct health products/services being offered in a single visit. There is a high risk that the instructions and importance of water treatment will be lost in the noise, leading to low salience and subsequent non-use.
-   **Trust in Messenger (moderate ↑):** Delivery by a "health team" associated with vaccines likely confers a high degree of authority and trustworthiness, which could increase the perceived importance of all items in the bundle, including chlorine.
-   **Low Baseline & MDE (moderate ↑):** The baseline usage is very low (~8%) and the minimum detectable effect (MDE) is a modest 5 percentage points. Achieving 13% usage in the treatment group seems highly plausible for a direct distribution intervention, even with imperfect uptake.
-   **Product Confusion (moderate ↓):** Recipients may view ORS/zinc (for treating diarrhea) and chlorine (for preventing it) as substitutes or become confused about their proper use, potentially depressing chlorine adoption.
-   **Study Power & Quality (moderate ↑):** The study is explicitly "powered to detect" the 5 percentage point effect, and the involvement of GiveWell and Wageningen University suggests a high-quality design and implementation, minimizing the risk of failing to detect a true effect due to methodological flaws.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **The Bundle:** Unlike classic water treatment studies that focused solely on chlorine, this intervention is a "kitchen sink" approach. The primary uncertainty stems from the psychological and behavioral effects of bundling, which is a major deviation from the reference class.
-   **Dual Measurement:** The study will use both self-reported usage and direct water testing for chlorine. This is a methodological strength, as it can overcome reporting bias, but also sets a higher bar for success than self-report alone.
-   **Specific Context:** Sierra Leone's health system has unique fragilities (e.g., post-Ebola recovery) and the target population may have less exposure to health authorities than in other well-studied countries like Kenya. This could lead to unpredictable responses.
-   **Explicit Funder Prior:** It is unusual to have the funder's (GiveWell's) internal forecast of 80% stated so clearly. This is a powerful piece of evidence from a well-informed actor.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a prior of ~75% based on the reference class of well-powered RCTs for free health product distribution. This is a strong prior, equivalent to observing ~10-15 similar studies.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ large) Free, convenient, door-to-door delivery is a proven, powerful mechanism.
    -   (↓ large) The bundling of 5+ interventions creates significant risk of information overload and confusion, a key departure from the reference class.
    -   (↑ moderate) The MDE is a relatively low bar (5 pp increase), making detection easier.
    -   (↑ moderate) The high-quality research team and explicit powering of the study reduces the risk of methodological failure.
    -   (↑ small) The strong, explicit prior from GiveWell (80%) is a positive signal from an informed actor.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence presents a strong tension between the proven effectiveness of the core delivery mechanism and the novel risk of bundling. The negative potential of bundling is significant, but likely not enough to fully counteract the powerful positive effects of free, direct distribution and a low MDE. The posterior should likely remain high, perhaps slightly above the initial prior and close to GiveWell's forecast.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Publication of a pre-analysis plan confirming robust power calculations and mitigation strategies for information overload.
    -   Positive preliminary reports or blog posts from GiveWell/Wageningen on the first round of distribution.
    -   News of localized waterborne disease outbreaks in Sierra Leone (would increase salience of water treatment).
    -   Evidence from other studies that bundled health interventions do not suffer from significant behavioral "crowding out."
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Reports of logistical challenges or delays in the study's implementation.
    -   Political instability or a major health crisis (e.g., another epidemic) in Sierra Leone that disrupts the study.
    -   The study team reporting higher-than-expected baseline chlorine use, which would make a 5pp *increase* harder to achieve and detect.
    -   The resolution date (Jan 1, 2026) approaching without any public release of results.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Resolution by Incompletion:** The question resolves to "No" if the study is not completed and results are not found by Jan 1, 2026. Field RCTs are prone to delays; this is a non-trivial risk.
-   **"Statistically Significant":** This depends on the p-value threshold chosen by the researchers (typically p < 0.05). The exact statistical model (e.g., adjustments for clustering) will matter.
-   **Effect vs. Detection:** The question is about *finding* a significant effect, not just whether an effect *exists*. The study could fail to find an effect due to insufficient power if the true effect is real but smaller than 5pp (e.g., 3-4pp).
-   **Measurement Error:** While water testing is more objective than self-report, it's a point-in-time measurement and can miss inconsistent users. The specific outcome measure (e.g., any chlorine detected vs. correct concentration) will be important.

**Final Research Summary:** The intervention uses a highly effective delivery mechanism (free, door-to-door) for a proven product, and the study is well-powered to detect a modest increase. The primary risk is that bundling the chlorine with numerous other health products will cause information overload, depressing uptake below the detectable threshold.

To forecast the probability that the study of chlorine distribution in Sierra Leone will find a statistically significant increase in chlorine usage by the recipients, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class 1:** Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) of free point-of-use (POU) water treatment products in Sub-Saharan Africa have a base rate of 70-85% for finding a statistically significant positive effect. This is due to the effectiveness of removing cost and access barriers.
- **Reference Class 2:** GiveWell-funded RCTs for well-understood, high-impact interventions have a base rate of 75-90% for finding a statistically significant effect. These studies are typically well-designed and powered.
- **Chosen Prior:** Given the overlap and the specific context of this study, a prior probability of 75% is reasonable, reflecting the lower end of the GiveWell-funded RCTs base rate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The study uses a proven delivery mechanism (free, door-to-door) and is well-powered, aligning with the reference classes.
- **Differences:** The bundling of multiple health interventions introduces a novel risk of information overload, which is not typical in the reference class.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Free & Convenient Delivery:** Strong evidence (↑ large) that this mechanism increases uptake, consistent with prior studies.
- **Bundling & Information Overload:** Significant risk (↓ large) that the bundling of interventions may dilute the focus on chlorine usage.
- **Low Baseline & MDE:** Moderate evidence (↑ moderate) that achieving a 5 percentage point increase is plausible given the low baseline.
- **Study Power & Quality:** Moderate evidence (↑ moderate) that the study's design and execution are robust.
- **GiveWell's Forecast:** Small positive signal (↑ small) from GiveWell's 80% forecast.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 75% probability translates to odds of 3:1.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio is slightly above 1, given the strong positive mechanisms and the significant but not overwhelming negative of bundling.
- **Posterior Odds:** Adjusting the prior odds by the likelihood ratio results in slightly increased odds.
- **Posterior Probability:** Converting the updated odds back to probability results in a posterior probability slightly higher than the prior, around 78-80%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The bundling risk is significant, but the strong delivery mechanism and study design mitigate this. The forecast remains robust.
- **Tail Risks:** Consideration of potential disruptions (e.g., political instability) is necessary but not currently pressing.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A lower probability could be argued if bundling effects are more detrimental than anticipated, but the evidence supports a higher likelihood of success.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering all factors, the final forecast is 80%, aligning closely with GiveWell's internal forecast and reflecting both the base rate and the impact of the evidence.

Final: 80%

# Probability Assessment: Will the Sierra Leone chlorine study find a statistically significant increase in usage?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use the reference class of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing free distribution of point-of-use water treatment products in Sub-Saharan Africa.

**Base rate: 75%**

Justification:
- Free distribution of health products typically shows significant positive effects in RCTs
- GiveWell-funded studies are generally well-designed and adequately powered
- The study is explicitly powered to detect a 5 percentage point increase from an 8% baseline
- GiveWell's own internal forecast is 80%, which is a strong signal from a well-informed actor

This base rate represents the probability that a well-designed RCT testing free distribution of a proven health product will detect a statistically significant positive effect.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Free distribution of a proven health intervention (chlorine for water treatment)
- Door-to-door delivery, removing access barriers
- Well-designed RCT with adequate power (explicitly powered to detect a 5pp effect)
- Low baseline usage (8%) means even modest adoption would yield a detectable effect
- Reputable research team (Wageningen University)

**Differences from base case:**
- Bundling with multiple other health interventions (vaccines, VAS, deworming, ORS/zinc)
- Two measurement approaches (self-report and direct water testing)
- Specific context of Sierra Leone, which may have unique challenges
- Two rounds of distribution with a 3-month gap, which could reinforce the intervention

The key difference is the bundling of chlorine with multiple other interventions, which could reduce its effectiveness through information overload or confusion.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Free door-to-door distribution**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If the intervention works, we would expect to see free door-to-door distribution
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even if the intervention fails, this delivery method would still be used
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.9 (strongly increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Bundling with multiple interventions**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - A successful intervention might still use bundling for efficiency
- P(E|~H): High (~0.9) - If the intervention fails, bundling and information overload is a likely cause
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.67 (moderately decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: Low baseline (8%) and modest MDE (5pp)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.9) - A successful intervention would target areas with low baseline usage
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even failed interventions would target low-usage areas
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8 (strongly increases probability)

**Evidence 4: GiveWell's 80% internal forecast**
- P(E|H): High (~0.9) - If the study will succeed, GiveWell would likely forecast success
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.3) - If the study will fail, GiveWell would be less likely to forecast success
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0 (strongly increases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 75%/25% = 3:1

Update on Evidence 1 (free distribution):
- Posterior odds = 3 × 1.9 = 5.7:1
- Posterior probability = 5.7/(1+5.7) ≈ 85%

Update on Evidence 2 (bundling):
- Posterior odds = 5.7 × 0.67 = 3.82:1
- Posterior probability = 3.82/(1+3.82) ≈ 79%

Update on Evidence 3 (low baseline):
- Posterior odds = 3.82 × 1.8 = 6.88:1
- Posterior probability = 6.88/(1+6.88) ≈ 87%

Update on Evidence 4 (GiveWell forecast):
- Posterior odds = 6.88 × 3.0 = 20.64:1
- Posterior probability = 20.64/(1+20.64) ≈ 95%

This seems too high given the uncertainties, so I need to adjust for overconfidence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting GiveWell's forecast (they could have biases or incomplete information)
- The bundling effect could be more severe than anticipated
- Study implementation challenges in Sierra Leone could be underestimated
- The question resolves "No" if results aren't published by Jan 2026, creating timeline risk

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The true effect could be real but smaller than 5pp, leading to a statistically insignificant result
- Recipients might view chlorine and ORS as substitutes, reducing chlorine adoption
- Political instability or health crises could disrupt the study
- The study might face delays and not publish results before the resolution date

**Adjustment for overconfidence:**
My final probability should be lower than 95% to account for these uncertainties. The bundling effect is a significant concern that differentiates this study from the reference class. GiveWell's 80% forecast already incorporates expert judgment about these factors.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I believe the probability should be close to but slightly higher than GiveWell's own forecast. The strong positive factors (free distribution, low baseline, adequate power) slightly outweigh the concerns about bundling and implementation challenges.

Final: 82%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate reference class for this question is "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) of free, point-of-use health product distribution in low-income countries, funded by sophisticated actors like GiveWell."

-   **RCTs of free product distribution:** Studies consistently show that removing cost and access barriers via free, convenient delivery is a highly effective mechanism for increasing the uptake of health products like water chlorination tablets. The effect is usually large and statistically significant.
-   **GiveWell-funded studies:** GiveWell typically funds research on interventions for which there is already a strong evidence base. They are not funding highly speculative trials but rather seeking to refine effect size estimates in new contexts or with new delivery models. This means the studies they fund are selected for a high probability of success.

Combining these, the base rate for such a study finding a statistically significant positive effect is very high. A reasonable prior probability P(H) is **80%**. This aligns with the base rates suggested in the research report (70-90%) and happens to match GiveWell's internal forecast, which can be seen as an expert-calibrated prior. In odds form, this is 4-to-1 in favor of the event.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
-   **Similarities:** The core of the intervention—free, door-to-door delivery of a proven product (chlorine)—is a perfect match for the reference class of highly effective interventions. The study design is an RCT, and the context is a low-income country with low baseline usage (~8%), where large relative gains are plausible.
-   **Differences:** The primary difference is the **bundling** of the chlorine with at least four other health services (vaccines, VAS, deworming, ORS/zinc). This is a significant deviation from typical single-intervention studies. This introduces a novel risk of information overload, where the instructions and importance of daily water chlorination (a habit-formation task) might be lost among simpler, one-off interventions (like taking a pill). This is the main factor that could make this case different from the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will start with the 80% prior and update it based on the specific evidence.

-   **Evidence 1: Bundling of multiple health products (Negative)**
    -   This is the strongest piece of evidence suggesting the outcome might be negative. Recipients may be overwhelmed, confused, or fail to prioritize the most effortful item (chlorine).
    -   P(Bundling | Significant Effect) is lower than P(Bundling | No Significant Effect). The bundling is a primary causal pathway to failure (i.e., the effect size being too small to detect).
    -   Likelihood Ratio: < 1. This evidence significantly decreases the probability from the base rate.

-   **Evidence 2: Low Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) of 5 percentage points (Positive)**
    -   The study is powered to detect a relatively modest absolute increase in usage (from 8% to 13%). A low bar is easier to clear. Even if bundling reduces the effectiveness of the distribution compared to a standalone intervention, the remaining effect may still easily surpass this 5pp threshold.
    -   P(Low MDE | Significant Effect) is higher than P(Low MDE | No Significant Effect). This design choice makes finding a significant result more likely for any given true effect.
    -   Likelihood Ratio: > 1. This evidence increases the probability, counteracting some of the negative impact of bundling.

-   **Evidence 3: High-quality research team and funder (Positive)**
    -   The involvement of Wageningen University and GiveWell implies a well-designed, adequately powered, and well-executed study. This reduces the risk of failure due to methodological flaws (e.g., implementation issues, insufficient sample size).
    -   Likelihood Ratio: > 1. This reinforces the high prior.

-   **Evidence 4: Risk of non-completion by Jan 1, 2026 (Negative)**
    -   The resolution criteria state that the question resolves to "No" if the study is not completed on time. Field RCTs are prone to delays. The ~19-month timeline from grant to resolution is plausible but not guaranteed. This introduces a small but real risk of failure independent of the intervention's effectiveness.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's start with the prior odds of 4:1 (80%).

1.  **Prior:** 80% (4:1 odds).
2.  **Update for Bundling:** The risk of information overload is significant. Let's estimate this reduces the odds of success by 40% (a likelihood ratio of 0.6).
    -   Posterior Odds = 4 * 0.6 = 2.4-to-1.
    -   This corresponds to a probability of 2.4 / 3.4 ≈ 70.6%.
3.  **Update for Low MDE:** The low 5pp bar is a strong positive factor. Let's say this increases the odds by 30% (a likelihood ratio of 1.3).
    -   Posterior Odds = 2.4 * 1.3 = 3.12-to-1.
    -   This corresponds to a probability of 3.12 / 4.12 ≈ 75.7%.

This calculation suggests that the specific negative and positive factors roughly balance out, keeping the probability high but slightly below the initial 80% prior. GiveWell's own 80% forecast is a very strong signal from an informed actor who has likely considered these same factors with more internal data (e.g., the full study proposal and power calculations). Their forecast likely already incorporates risks like implementation delays. Deferring significantly to their expertise is warranted. My calculation landing at ~76% suggests their 80% is very reasonable and perhaps I am slightly overweighting the bundling risk.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~76-80% could be wrong for several reasons.

-   **Why it might be too high:** The negative effect of bundling on a *habit-formation* product like chlorine could be much larger than for one-off treatments. Chlorine requires daily effort and memory, making it uniquely vulnerable to being crowded out in a complex bundle. The true effect could easily be positive but fall in the 1-4pp range, leading to a "No" resolution.
-   **Why it might be too low:** I might be underestimating the sheer power of free, convenient, door-to-door delivery by a trusted health team. The effect of this delivery mechanism in other contexts has been massive (e.g., 30-50pp increases). Even if bundling cuts this effect by 75%, the remainder would still be >5pp. From this view, failure is very unlikely. GiveWell's 80% might even be conservative.

On balance, the red team analysis doesn't provide a compelling reason to move far from the 80% anchor. The tension between the powerful positive mechanism and the novel negative risk is the core of the question, and an outcome in the 75-85% range seems to correctly price this tension. I will settle on a number slightly below GiveWell's forecast to account for the unique uncertainty introduced by the bundling design.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for a well-designed study on a proven intervention like this is high, around 80%. The primary negative factor is the bundling of multiple interventions, which creates a risk of information overload and may depress chlorine uptake. However, this is counteracted by the study being powered to detect a relatively small effect size (a 5 percentage point increase), which makes finding a statistically significant result easier. GiveWell's own forecast of 80% is a strong anchor from an informed party. My analysis suggests the specific risks and benefits of this trial roughly balance, leading to a posterior probability that remains high. I will adjust slightly downwards from GiveWell's forecast to reflect the novel uncertainty of the bundling approach.

Final: 78%
