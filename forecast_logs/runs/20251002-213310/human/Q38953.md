### Reference class & base rates
-   **Major Middle East Wars (Post-1948):** This class includes conflicts like the Arab-Israeli Wars (1948, 1967, 1973), the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88), and the Gulf War (1990-91). In several of these, new state actors joined after the initial outbreak. For example, in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Jordan, Iraq, and other Arab nations joined the initial Syrian-Egyptian attack on Israel. In the Gulf War, a large coalition formed to attack Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait. This reference class suggests a **base rate of 15-30%** for a new country joining a major regional war within a six-month period.
-   **Direct Confrontations Involving a Superpower:** This class includes conflicts where a superpower is a primary belligerent from the early stages, such as the Vietnam War or the Soviet-Afghan War. Third-party state entry into direct combat against the superpower or its primary adversary is extremely rare due to the high risk of catastrophic escalation. This reference class suggests a **base rate of <5%**.
-   **Israel-Iran Proxy Conflicts (2010-Present):** This long-running "shadow war" has seen extensive conflict, primarily in third countries like Syria and Lebanon, and via covert operations. No new state actor has directly attacked the territory of either Iran or Israel as part of this conflict. This suggests a **base rate near 0%**, but its utility is limited as the current scenario has moved beyond proxy warfare into direct state-on-state conflict.

*Limitations:* The current scenario is a hybrid, possessing features of all three classes. It is a major Middle East war, but the direct, early involvement of the US makes it fundamentally different from the Arab-Israeli wars.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-09-11] Report: US Air Force wants an even bigger bunker-buster bomb than the GBU-57 used in June. (↔) — Matters as it signals long-term US intent to hold Iranian hard targets at risk, but has no immediate effect on a *new* country's decision to join the war.
-   [2025-09-09] US fast-tracks development of Next-Gen Penetrator (NGP) bomb after its "deadly debut" in Iran. (↔) — Similar to above, this reinforces US strategic posture but does not directly alter the short-term calculus for regional actors within the forecast window.
-   [2025-08-22] (Hypothetical) Russia delivers a new S-400 battery to Iran and issues a stern warning against further "destabilizing" strikes. (↑) — Increases the defensive capability of Iran and signals Russian backing, potentially emboldening an ally like Syria or creating miscalculation risks.
-   [2025-08-15] (Hypothetical) Saudi Arabia and UAE announce joint air defense drills, citing "regional threats." (↓) — A defensive posture aimed at deterring Iranian retaliation, signaling a desire to stay out of the conflict rather than to enter it offensively.
-   [2025-07-28] (Hypothetical) Skirmishes on the Lebanon-Israel border intensify, with Hezbollah rocket fire and Israeli air strikes. (↑) — Increases the risk that the Lebanese state, willingly or not, becomes formally involved in the conflict, meeting the resolution criteria.
-   [2025-07-10] (Hypothetical) China calls for an immediate ceasefire at the UN Security Council and dispatches diplomatic envoys to Riyadh, Tehran, and Jerusalem. (↓) — Major international powers actively working on de-escalation and containment reduces the likelihood of the conflict widening.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Alliance Entanglement / Escalation Spiral (Large):** The most likely driver. A stray Iranian missile hitting Jordan or Kuwait, or intensified Hezbollah attacks from Lebanon could drag a neighboring state into the conflict, even against its strategic interest.
-   **Opportunistic Aggression (Moderate):** A regional rival (e.g., Saudi Arabia) might see an opportunity to deal a decisive blow to a weakened Iran. However, the risk of direct, devastating retaliation from Iran is a powerful counterweight.
-   **Superpower Deterrence (Large):** The active combat involvement of the United States dramatically raises the stakes. Any country attacking Israel risks facing the US military. Any country attacking Iran risks being seen as an accessory to the US/Israel, making them a target for Iranian retaliation. This strongly incentivizes non-involvement.
-   **Diplomatic Containment (Moderate):** The global economic consequences of a wider Middle East war (especially on energy prices) would spur intense diplomatic efforts by Europe, China, and non-belligerent regional states to keep the conflict ring-fenced.
-   **Iranian "Axis of Resistance" (Small):** Iran could call on allies like Syria to join the fight. However, the Syrian state is severely weakened and unlikely to launch a meaningful attack on Israel's borders that would risk its own destruction, unless directly attacked first.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Direct US Combat Involvement:** Unlike the 1973 war or the Iran-Iraq war, the US is not a supplier or distant supporter but a direct, declared combatant. This fundamentally changes the risk calculus for any potential new entrant.
-   **Overt, Homeland-to-Homeland Strikes:** The conflict is not confined to a third-country battlefield (like Syria) or a disputed territory. It involves direct missile, drone, and air attacks on the sovereign territory of Iran and Israel, making any intervention a clear act of war.
-   **Lack of a Broad Coalition:** The initial Arab-Israeli wars were driven by a pan-Arab coalition. Today, several key Arab states (UAE, Bahrain, tacitly Saudi Arabia) are more aligned with Israel's position on Iran, but they also have strong incentives to avoid direct war. There is no pre-existing, unified bloc poised to intervene.
-   **High-Tech, Destructive Warfare:** The demonstrated effectiveness of modern ballistic missiles, drones, and 5th-generation aircraft means any new entrant would face immediate and severe consequences. The deterrence factor is higher than in past conventional wars.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior of ~15%, derived from the reference class of major Middle East wars, seems plausible. This should be a weak prior (equivalent n of ~10-15) given the rarity and heterogeneity of these events.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓↓) Direct and early US combat involvement acts as a massive deterrent to all potential entrants, both pro-Iran and anti-Iran. (Large)
    -   (↓) The overt nature of homeland attacks raises the threshold for intervention compared to proxy wars or conflicts over third-party territory. (Moderate)
    -   (↓) Apparent defensive posturing by Gulf Arab states and active containment diplomacy by global powers suggest a strong preference for non-expansion. (Moderate)
    -   (↑) The risk of miscalculation or spillover from Lebanon/Syria remains a significant, non-zero pathway to a new country's involvement. (Moderate)
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points downward. The deterrent effect of direct US participation is the single most important factor and likely overwhelms other potential drivers. The posterior should be significantly lower than the initial base rate.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Official statements from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, or Turkey explicitly blaming one side for an incident and threatening retaliation.
    -   Sustained, large-scale mobilization of conventional forces (not just air defense) on the borders of Syria, Jordan, or Iraq.
    -   A direct, high-casualty attack on a third-party nation's assets (e.g., a naval vessel in the Gulf, a major border outpost).
    -   The Lebanese Armed Forces becoming overtly involved in Hezbollah-Israel clashes.
    -   Reports of Russian "volunteers" or advisors being killed in Iran, prompting a Russian state response.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Establishment of a multilateral diplomatic contact group (e.g., by the P5+1) to mediate de-escalation.
    -   Public statements from Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Jordan calling for restraint from all parties.
    -   A significant reduction in the tempo of Iran-Israel-US strikes.
    -   Successful UN or third-party mediation of a ceasefire on the Lebanon-Israel border.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Non-State Actors as a Catalyst:** The resolution criteria specify a *country*. The most plausible path for this is a non-state actor like Hezbollah dragging the Lebanese state into the conflict. The distinction between Hezbollah's actions and Lebanon's official involvement could be a gray area.
-   **Fog of War & Misattribution:** An attack could be misattributed. A third country might be struck by one of the belligerents, who then falsely blames their opponent, creating a pretext for that third country to enter the war.
-   **Definitional Gotchas:** The "20 official military personnel" clause is specific. A small-scale cross-border raid by special forces might not trigger resolution, even if it is an act of aggression.
-   **Fictional Scenario:** This analysis is based on a fictional scenario. Real-world reactions could be influenced by unknown political dynamics or "black swan" events not considered here.
-   **Rational Actor Assumption:** The analysis assumes most state leaders will act rationally to avoid a catastrophic, widening war. An irrational decision by a key leader could override the structural deterrents.

**Final Research Summary:**
The historical base rate for a new country joining a major Middle East war is non-trivial. However, the direct and early combat involvement of the United States in this fictional conflict creates an exceptionally strong deterrent, making it highly unlikely that any new nation will risk a direct attack on either Israel or Iran.

To forecast the probability of a new country attacking Israel or Iran between June and December 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The historical base rate for a new country joining a major Middle East war within a six-month period is estimated at 15-30%. This is based on past conflicts where new state actors joined after the initial outbreak, such as the Arab-Israeli Wars and the Gulf War.
- **Chosen Prior:** Given the current scenario's complexity, a base rate of 15% is selected. This reflects the lower end of the range due to the unique factors at play, particularly the direct involvement of the US.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current conflict is a major Middle East war, similar to past conflicts where new countries have joined.
- **Differences:** The direct involvement of the US as a combatant is a significant deterrent, unlike in past regional wars. Additionally, the conflict involves direct homeland-to-homeland strikes, raising the stakes for any potential new entrant.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Direct US Involvement:** The likelihood of a new country joining is significantly reduced due to the high risk of escalation with a superpower involved. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.
- **Regional Defensive Postures:** Saudi Arabia and UAE's defensive drills and calls for restraint suggest a preference for non-involvement, further decreasing the probability.
- **Potential for Miscalculation:** Skirmishes on the Lebanon-Israel border and Hezbollah's involvement slightly increase the probability, but this is a moderate factor compared to the deterrent effects.
- **Diplomatic Efforts:** China's call for a ceasefire and diplomatic efforts by major powers decrease the probability of conflict expansion.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 15% translates to odds of 0.176 (15/85).
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the strong deterrent effect of US involvement and regional defensive postures, the likelihood ratio is estimated to be significantly less than 1, say 0.5.
- **Posterior Odds:** 0.176 × 0.5 = 0.088.
- **Posterior Probability:** 0.088 / (1 + 0.088) ≈ 8.1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The analysis assumes rational behavior by state actors, which may not always hold. An irrational decision or a black swan event could alter the dynamics.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A significant miscalculation or an unexpected provocation could lead to a new entrant. However, these remain less likely given the current deterrents.
- **Adjustment:** Considering these factors, a slight upward adjustment to account for unforeseen events is prudent.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** After considering all factors, the final forecast probability is adjusted to reflect both the base rate and the impact of the evidence.

Final: 10%

# Probability Analysis: Will any new country attack Israel or Iran between June and December 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for a new country joining an ongoing Middle East conflict by directly attacking one of the main belligerents.

Looking at major Middle East conflicts since 1948:
- Arab-Israeli Wars (1948, 1967, 1973): Multiple countries joined these conflicts
- Lebanon War (1982): Limited to Israel, PLO, and Syria
- Gulf War (1990-91): Coalition formed against Iraq
- Iraq War (2003): Coalition formed against Iraq
- Israel-Hezbollah War (2006): Remained contained
- Israel-Hamas conflicts: Generally remained contained

The most relevant reference class is major Middle East wars involving direct state-on-state conflict with a superpower involved. In these cases, the likelihood of new countries joining by directly attacking a main belligerent is relatively low, especially after the initial outbreak phase.

**Prior probability: 12%**

This reflects that while Middle East conflicts can draw in multiple actors, the specific conditions of this scenario (direct US involvement, ongoing conflict between nuclear-capable states) create strong deterrence against new entrants.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Regional tensions involving Israel and its adversaries
- Active military operations in the Middle East
- Involvement of proxy forces and non-state actors
- History of alliance networks in the region

**Key differences:**
- Direct US military involvement as an active combatant (highly unusual)
- Direct homeland-to-homeland strikes between Iran and Israel (escalation beyond proxy warfare)
- The conflict is already several months old (most new entrants join early)
- Modern precision weapons and air defense systems raise costs of entry
- Many Arab states have normalized or improved relations with Israel

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood compared to historical cases. The US involvement creates an especially powerful deterrent for any country considering attacking Israel, while attacking Iran would risk being seen as joining the US-Israel coalition.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Direct US combat involvement**
- P(E|H): If a new country were to attack, despite US involvement, this would be somewhat unlikely (~0.3)
- P(E|~H): If no new country attacks, US involvement would be a major reason why (~0.8)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.8 = 0.375
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Ongoing border skirmishes with Lebanon/Hezbollah**
- P(E|H): If Lebanon formally enters the war, these skirmishes would likely precede it (~0.8)
- P(E|~H): If no new country attacks, these skirmishes might still occur but remain contained (~0.5)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.5 = 1.6
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Defensive posturing by Gulf states**
- P(E|H): If a Gulf state were planning to attack, they might still conduct defensive drills as cover (~0.3)
- P(E|~H): If Gulf states want to avoid the conflict, defensive posturing is very likely (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Reported Russian support for Iran (S-400 delivery)**
- P(E|H): If a new country attacks, Russian support might embolden them (~0.6)
- P(E|~H): If no new country attacks, Russian support might still occur but remain limited (~0.4)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.6/0.4 = 1.5
- This moderately increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 12%/(100%-12%) = 0.136

First update (US involvement):
- Posterior odds = 0.136 × 0.375 = 0.051
- Posterior probability = 0.051/(1+0.051) ≈ 4.9%

Second update (Lebanon/Hezbollah skirmishes):
- Posterior odds = 0.051 × 1.6 = 0.0816
- Posterior probability = 0.0816/(1+0.0816) ≈ 7.5%

Third update (Gulf states defensive posturing):
- Posterior odds = 0.0816 × 0.33 = 0.0269
- Posterior probability = 0.0269/(1+0.0269) ≈ 2.6%

Fourth update (Russian support for Iran):
- Posterior odds = 0.0269 × 1.5 = 0.04035
- Posterior probability = 0.04035/(1+0.04035) ≈ 3.9%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the deterrent effect of US involvement
- I might be underestimating the risk of accidental escalation or miscalculation
- The Lebanon-Israel border situation could deteriorate rapidly
- Syrian involvement could be triggered by Israeli strikes on Iranian assets in Syria

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Lebanon's military could be drawn into conflict if Hezbollah operations from Lebanese territory intensify (10-15% probability)
- Syria might retaliate if Israel conducts major operations against Iranian assets on Syrian soil (5-8% probability)
- A Gulf state might opportunistically strike Iran if it appears severely weakened (2-3% probability)

**Counterarguments:**
- The 20-personnel threshold in the resolution criteria is quite specific and high
- Most regional actors have strong incentives to avoid direct involvement
- The time window (October-December 2025) is relatively short
- The conflict has already been ongoing for months without new entrants

After considering these factors, I should adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for the Lebanon/Syria risk scenarios, which I may have underweighted.

## 6. Final Forecast

After careful consideration of the base rate, evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess the probability that a new country will attack Israel or Iran between now (October 2) and December 31, 2025 to be 5%.

The most likely pathway would be Lebanon being drawn into direct conflict due to escalating Hezbollah operations, but even this scenario faces significant deterrents given US involvement and the high costs of direct engagement.

Final: 5%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will use the reference class of "Major Middle East Wars since 1948." This class includes conflicts like the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the 1967 Six-Day War, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Iran-Iraq War, and the 1991 Gulf War. In several of these conflicts, additional state actors joined after the initial outbreak. For instance, in 1973, Jordan and Iraq, among others, joined the initial Syrian-Egyptian attack on Israel. This historical pattern suggests that the widening of major regional conflicts is a recurring phenomenon. Based on this reference class, a base rate of a new country joining within a six-month window is non-trivial. I will set the initial prior probability P(H) at **20%**. This reflects a roughly 1-in-5 chance, acknowledging the historical tendency for such wars to expand.
*   **Prior Probability P(H):** 20%
*   **Prior Odds:** 0.20 / (1 - 0.20) = 1:4

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current fictional scenario has critical differences from the historical base case, which must be used to adjust the prior.

*   **Similarities:** The conflict is a high-intensity, state-on-state war between major regional powers, creating significant potential for spillover and escalation involving neighboring countries.
*   **Differences:** The most significant difference is the **direct and early combat involvement of the United States**. In past Arab-Israeli wars, the US was a supplier and supporter, not a direct combatant firing on a belligerent's homeland. US combat involvement fundamentally alters the strategic calculus for any potential new entrant.
    *   Attacking Israel means attacking a nation actively fighting alongside the US military, risking direct conflict with a superpower.
    *   Attacking Iran means joining a US-led war, which invites devastating Iranian retaliation and potential international condemnation.
    This superpower deterrence is a powerful force for containment that was not present in the same way in the 1967 or 1973 wars. Furthermore, unlike the pan-Arab coalitions of the past, the current geopolitical alignment sees key Arab states (like Saudi Arabia and the UAE) more concerned with containing Iran than fighting Israel, making a broad coalition against Israel highly improbable.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence from the scenario to update the prior.

*   **Evidence 1: Direct US Combat Involvement (↓↓)**
    *   This is the single most important piece of evidence. It dramatically increases the perceived cost of intervention for any other state actor. It acts as a powerful deterrent for both potential allies of Iran (e.g., Syria) and potential opportunists (e.g., Saudi Arabia).
    *   Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H) / P(E|~H)) is significantly less than 1. This evidence strongly decreases the probability of the war widening.

*   **Evidence 2: The Lebanon/Hezbollah Escalation Pathway (↑)**
    *   The most plausible mechanism for a new country to join is Lebanon being dragged into the conflict. Iran's primary proxy, Hezbollah, is based in Lebanon and would likely be ordered to open a second front. Intense Hezbollah attacks would provoke massive Israeli retaliation, potentially against Lebanese state infrastructure and military (LAF) positions.
    *   If the LAF returns fire or becomes overtly involved in clashes, this would meet the resolution criteria for "Lebanon attacking Israel." The weakness of the Lebanese state and its inability to control Hezbollah makes this scenario of unwilling or accidental entry a significant risk.
    *   This evidence increases the probability, as it provides a specific and plausible causal pathway for the event to occur, which might not exist in other hypothetical conflicts.

*   **Evidence 3: Defensive Posturing of Gulf States & Diplomatic Containment (↓)**
    *   The hypothetical report of Saudi/UAE air defense drills and Chinese diplomatic efforts points towards a strong international and regional preference for containing the conflict. These actors have a vested interest in stability and would actively work to prevent the war from spreading.
    *   This evidence decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will perform a conceptual update based on the evidence.

1.  **Start with Prior Odds:** 1:4 (20% probability).
2.  **Apply Evidence of US Involvement:** This is the strongest factor. I'll estimate this reduces the odds by a factor of four (a likelihood ratio of 1/4), reflecting a powerful deterrent effect.
    *   Updated Odds = (1:4) × (1/4) = 1:16.
    *   Updated Probability = 1 / (1 + 16) ≈ 5.9%.
3.  **Apply Competing Evidence:** The strong downward pressure from Gulf State neutrality and diplomacy is counteracted by the significant upward pressure from the plausible Lebanon escalation pathway. I assess that the Lebanon risk is substantial enough to roughly double the odds from their lowest point, as it represents a clear and present mechanism for escalation that superpower deterrence may not fully prevent.
    *   Final Odds = (1:16) × 2 = 2:16 = 1:8.
    *   **Resulting Probability (for the full 6-month period):** 1 / (1 + 8) ≈ 11.1%.

This 11% represents the probability of the event occurring over the entire six-month window (July-December 2025), as viewed from the beginning of the conflict. However, the forecast is being made on October 2, 2025. Roughly half of the resolution period has passed without the event occurring. This is new information. Assuming a roughly constant risk over the period, the fact that we are halfway through without an incident should approximately halve the remaining probability.

*   Initial forecast (for full period): ~11% (Odds ~1:8)
*   Update for time passed: The odds of it happening in the second half, given it didn't happen in the first, are lower. This is equivalent to applying a likelihood ratio of ~0.5 to the odds.
*   Final Odds ≈ 1:(8 * 2) = 1:16.
*   **Final Posterior Probability ≈ 1 / (1 + 16) ≈ 5.9%.**

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~6% is low, predicated on the strength of US deterrence. A key vulnerability in this forecast is underestimating the chaotic nature of war. The Lebanon scenario, where the state is dragged into conflict by a non-state actor, is the most likely path to a "Yes" resolution. I might be underestimating how easily the line between Hezbollah and the Lebanese state could blur in the eyes of military commanders and question resolvers during a full-scale war. An alternative forecast of 15-20% would argue that the historical base rate is more resilient and that major wars create unpredictable dynamics that overwhelm structural deterrents. However, I maintain that direct US combat involvement is a game-changing variable that makes this conflict fundamentally different from past regional wars. The low probability reflects the high bar for a new *nation-state* to formally launch an attack in such a volatile environment. The ~6% chance adequately prices in the primary risk of an unwilling escalation involving Lebanon. I will round up slightly to 7% to account for the possibility that tensions are still building and the risk is not perfectly linear over time.

### Final Forecast
The final forecast is based on a historical prior of 20%, which is then strongly revised downwards due to the powerful deterrent effect of direct US combat involvement. This is partially offset by the significant and plausible risk of the conflict widening through an escalation involving Hezbollah that drags the state of Lebanon into the war. A final adjustment is made for the fact that half the resolution period has passed without the event occurring.

Final: 7%
