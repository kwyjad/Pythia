BINARY CALIBRATION
- No resolved binary questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.
- Advice: keep using base rates + small evidence-weighted updates; avoid big swings.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE CALIBRATION (Top-1)
- No resolved MCQ questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.

NUMERIC CALIBRATION (PIT-lite + CRPS)
- No resolved numeric questions (with pre-resolution forecasts) yet.
- When numeric results exist, we’ll check p10/p50/p90 coverage and CRPS.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for a social media platform reaching 100 million users within a short timeframe after launch can be informed by historical examples. For instance, platforms like Instagram and TikTok reached 100 million users within 2-3 years of launch. Given Bluesky's current user base of 32 million and its growth trajectory, a reasonable base rate might be around 30-40% for reaching 100 million users by the end of 2025. This is based on the rapid growth seen in successful social media platforms.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: Bluesky, like Instagram and TikTok, is experiencing rapid growth and benefits from a shift in user preferences, partly due to dissatisfaction with existing platforms (e.g., Twitter/X).
       - Differences: Bluesky is a decentralized platform, which might appeal to a niche audience compared to the broader appeal of Instagram and TikTok. Additionally, the competitive landscape and user retention challenges could differ.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Evidence of rapid growth to 32 million users suggests a strong initial adoption, likely due to dissatisfaction with Twitter/X and political events. This increases the likelihood of continued growth.
       - The decentralized nature might limit mainstream appeal, reducing the likelihood of reaching 100 million users compared to more centralized platforms.
       - Likelihood ratio: The rapid growth and current user base suggest a higher likelihood of reaching 100 million users than not, but the niche appeal tempers this.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds: 0.35 / 0.65 (based on a 35% base rate)
       - Likelihood ratio: Assume a moderate increase in likelihood due to evidence, say 1.5.
       - Posterior odds = 0.35 / 0.65 * 1.5 ≈ 0.81
       - Posterior probability = 0.81 / (1 + 0.81) ≈ 0.45 or 45%
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The rapid growth might not sustain due to competition or market saturation.
       - Alternative scenario: Bluesky could fail to maintain momentum if new features or incentives aren't introduced.
       - Rebuttal: The dissatisfaction with Twitter/X and political factors could continue to drive growth.
       - Adjustments: Consider a slight reduction to account for potential overestimation of growth sustainability.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential overconfidence, a final probability of 42% seems reasonable.
    
    Final: 42%
