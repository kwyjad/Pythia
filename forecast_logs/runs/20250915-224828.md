## Per-model

- **OpenRouter-Default** ok=True time=9414ms cost=$9.9525 parsed={'P10': 1.0, 'P50': 1.0, 'P90': 3.0}

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - For the base rate, I will use the historical average difference in stock returns between Nvidia and Apple over similar biweekly periods. Historically, tech stocks like Nvidia and Apple have shown high volatility, with Nvidia often outperforming Apple in recent years. A reasonable base rate might assume a slight positive difference favoring Nvidia, given its recent performance. Let's assume a mean difference of 1 percentage point (pp) with a standard deviation of 3 pp, reflecting typical volatility.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - The current situation is similar to the base case in that both companies are leading tech firms with high volatility. However, Nvidia's recent outperformance and Apple's new software releases introduce potential deviations. Apple's new features could boost its stock, narrowing the gap.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Apple's new software features (↑): This could increase Apple's returns, making a smaller difference more likely.
       - Nvidia's stable performance (↓): Without new catalysts, Nvidia may not see as much of a boost, supporting a smaller difference.
       - General tech market volatility (↑): This could lead to larger swings, but not necessarily favoring one over the other.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - Prior: Mean = 1 pp, SD = 3 pp.
       - Evidence suggests a slight narrowing of the gap due to Apple's new features.
       - Posterior: Adjust mean to 0.5 pp, reflecting a slight shift towards Apple, with SD remaining at 3 pp due to persistent volatility.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate Apple's potential boost from new features.
       - Tail risks: Economic news or unexpected announcements could shift outcomes significantly.
       - Alternative forecast: A scenario where Apple's features significantly boost its stock, leading to a negative difference (Apple outperforming Nvidia).
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Adjusting for potential overconfidence and tail risks, I will widen the distribution slightly.
       - P10: -2
       - P20: -1
       - P40: 0

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To produce a probabilistic forecast for the difference in total price returns between Nasdaq-100 Futures and S&P 500 Futures for the period of September 29 to October 10, 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Base Rate**: Historically, during tech-driven bull markets, Nasdaq-100 has outperformed S&P 500 by 2-4 percentage points (pp) annually. Given the biweekly nature of the forecast, we adjust this to approximately 0.08-0.15 pp for a two-week period.
    - **Variance**: The tech sector's inherent volatility suggests a relatively high variance. We assume a standard deviation of 0.1 pp for this period.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarities**: The current environment includes strong tech earnings and innovation news, similar to past tech-driven periods.
    - **Differences**: Rising interest rates and increased regulatory scrutiny are atypical, potentially dampening the outperformance.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **Strong Tech Earnings**: Increases likelihood of outperformance; makes higher outcomes 2× as likely.
    - **Rising Interest Rates**: Decreases likelihood of outperformance; makes lower outcomes 1.5× as likely.
    - **Innovation News**: Increases likelihood of outperformance; makes higher outcomes 2× as likely.
    - **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Decreases likelihood of outperformance; makes lower outcomes 1.5× as likely.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
    - **Prior**: Mean = 0.1 pp, SD = 0.1 pp.
    - **Evidence Impact**: Strong tech earnings and innovation news outweigh interest rate and regulatory concerns, shifting the mean slightly upward.
    - **Posterior Mean**: Adjusted to 0.12 pp.
    - **Posterior Variance**: Increased slightly due to mixed evidence, SD = 0.12 pp.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: Consider potential economic shocks or unexpected regulatory changes.
    - **Alternative Scenario**: If interest rates rise more sharply than expected, Nasdaq-100 could underperform.
    - **Adjustment**: Broaden the distribution to account for these risks.
    
    ### 6. Final Percentiles
    - **P10**: -0.05 pp
    - **P20**: 0.00 pp
    - **P40**: 0.08 pp

- **Prior:** Assume a prior centered around 4.0% with moderate strength (equivalent n = 20).
- **Evidence mapping:**
  - ↓ Fed rate cut signals — moderate
  - ↑ Bond market resistance — moderate
  - ↓ Economic slowdown indicators — small
  - ↑ Inflation concerns — small
- **Net effect:** Posterior likely to move slightly down, reflecting mixed signals with a slight bias towards lower yields.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
  - Stronger-than-expected economic data
  - Rising inflation reports
  - Hawkish Fed statements
- **DOWN indicators:**
  - Fed rate cut announcements
  - Weak economic growth data
  - Increased geopolitical tensions

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Uncertainty in Fed Policy:** Potential for unexpected policy shifts.
- **Data Gaps:** Lag in economic data reporting.
- **Market Volatility:** Sudden shifts in investor sentiment.
- **Regime Changes:** Changes in Fed leadership or policy direction.
- **Definitional Gotchas:** Misinterpretation of yield curve signals.

Final Research Summary: The 10-Year Treasury yield is influenced by mixed signals, with potential downward pressure from Fed rate cut signals and economic slowdown indicators, but upward pressure from inflation concerns and bond market resistance. Forecasters should monitor Fed announcements and economic data closely.

## Per-model

- **OpenRouter-Default** ok=True time=14435ms cost=$10.7525 parsed={'P10': 1.0, 'P50': 10.0, 'P90': 2019.0}

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The historical range for the 10-Year Treasury Yield from 2019 to 2025 is typically between 0.5% and 4.0%. Given the current economic context and recent trends, a base rate centered around 4.0% is reasonable. This reflects a moderate economic environment with some inflationary pressures and Fed interventions.
       - Mean/Median: 4.0%, Variance: Moderate, reflecting typical fluctuations in yield due to economic conditions.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: Current economic conditions still reflect post-COVID recovery dynamics, with ongoing inflation concerns and Fed policy interventions.
       - Differences: The Fed's recent signals of rate cuts are unusual compared to historical tightening cycles, and there is notable resistance in the bond market to these cuts. Economic slowdown indicators are also emerging, which could lower yield expectations.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Fed rate cut signals (↓): This suggests a downward pressure on yields, making lower outcomes more likely.
       - Bond market resistance (↑): This could counteract some of the downward pressure, making higher yields more likely.
       - Economic slowdown indicators (↓): These support the likelihood of lower yields.
       - Inflation concerns (↑): These could push yields higher, though the impact is smaller compared to other factors.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - Start with a prior centered at 4.0%.
       - Fed rate cut signals and economic slowdown indicators suggest a downward adjustment.
       - Bond market resistance and inflation concerns provide upward pressure, but are less influential.
       - Posterior mean likely shifts slightly downward from 4.0%, with a slight increase in variance due to mixed signals.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Consider the possibility of stronger-than-expected economic data or unexpected Fed policy shifts that could lead to higher yields.
       - Tail risks include geopolitical tensions or sudden market volatility.
       - An alternative forecast might emphasize the bond market's resistance more heavily, suggesting less downward movement in yields.
       - Adjust percentiles to account for these risks, ensuring a balanced view of potential outcomes.
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Given the mixed evidence and slight downward bias, the forecasted percentiles are adjusted to reflect a slightly lower yield than the base rate, but with consideration for upward pressures.

### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical OAS Levels**: Over the past decade, the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS has typically ranged between 300-600 basis points, with spikes during economic stress.
- **Economic Downturns**: During recessions, spreads can exceed 800 basis points, reflecting heightened risk aversion.
- **Limitations**: Base rates can be skewed by extreme events (e.g., 2008 financial crisis), and may not account for current unique economic conditions.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-09-15] ↑ — Long-term unemployment at post-pandemic high, indicating potential economic stress.
- [2025-09-15] ↓ — Political tensions with potential national emergency declaration, increasing uncertainty.
- [2025-09-15] ↑ — Rising geopolitical tensions could lead to increased market volatility.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Economic Indicators**: Moderate impact; unemployment and GDP growth influence credit risk perceptions.
- **Monetary Policy**: Large impact; interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve affect bond yields.
- **Corporate Earnings**: Moderate impact; strong earnings can reduce perceived default risk.
- **Geopolitical Events**: Large impact; can cause sudden shifts in risk sentiment.
- **Market Liquidity**: Small impact; affects the ease of buying/selling high-yield bonds.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **High Unemployment**: Current levels are unusually high, suggesting increased economic risk.
- **Political Uncertainty**: Potential national emergency could disrupt markets more than typical political events.
- **Interest Rate Environment**: Current rates are higher than historical norms, affecting bond yields.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a prior centered around 400 basis points with moderate strength (equivalent n = 20).
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Long-term unemployment (moderate)
  - ↑ Political uncertainty (large)
  - ↓ Potential for strong corporate earnings (small)
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move up moderately due to increased economic and political risks.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Rising unemployment claims.
  - Increased geopolitical tensions.
  - Federal Reserve signaling rate hikes.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Strong corporate earnings reports.
  - De-escalation of political tensions.
  - Improved economic growth forecasts.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Data Gaps**: Delays in economic data can obscure real-time conditions.
- **Deception Risks**: Market sentiment can be swayed by misinformation.
- **Regime Changes**: Sudden policy shifts can alter economic forecasts.
- **Definitional Gotchas**: Changes in how spreads are calculated can affect comparability.

Final Research Summary: The ICE BofA US High Yield OAS is likely to increase moderately due to heightened economic and political risks, with unemployment and geopolitical tensions as key drivers. Forecasters should monitor economic indicators and political developments closely.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the ending value of the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) for the period of Sep 29 - Oct 10, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps.
    
    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The historical range for the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS over the past decade is typically between 300-600 basis points, with spikes during economic stress. Given the current economic and political environment, a base rate centered around 400 basis points is reasonable. This reflects a typical non-crisis period with moderate risk.
       - Mean/Median: 400 basis points; Variance: Moderate, reflecting typical market fluctuations.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The current situation shares characteristics with periods of moderate economic stress, such as high unemployment and geopolitical tensions.
       - Differences: The potential for a national emergency and higher interest rates are unusual factors that could increase spreads beyond typical levels.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Long-term unemployment at a post-pandemic high suggests increased economic risk, making higher spreads more likely.
       - Political uncertainty, with potential national emergency declarations, significantly increases market risk, pushing spreads higher.
       - Rising geopolitical tensions further increase market volatility, favoring higher spreads.
       - Potential for strong corporate earnings could slightly mitigate these risks, but the impact is small.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - Prior centered at 400 basis points.
       - Evidence suggests a moderate upward adjustment due to increased economic and political risks.
       - Posterior mean shifts upwards, with increased variance to account for heightened uncertainty.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The forecast could underestimate the impact of a sudden de-escalation in political tensions or unexpected positive economic data.
       - Tail risks: A significant geopolitical event or severe economic downturn could push spreads much higher.
       - Alternative forecast: A scenario where political tensions ease and economic indicators improve could lead to a lower spread, but current evidence does not strongly support this.
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Considering the evidence and potential risks, the forecasted percentiles are adjusted to reflect a moderate increase in the OAS.
    
    P10: 410
    P20: 420

— end calibration —

### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical VIX Spikes**: Typically, VIX spikes above 30 during periods of high market stress. Base rate for such spikes in a given biweekly period is low, around 5-10%.
- **Quarterly Earnings Seasons**: VIX tends to increase during earnings seasons, with moderate spikes (20-30) occurring in about 20% of periods.
- **Geopolitical Events**: Major geopolitical tensions can cause VIX to spike significantly, but these are less predictable and occur in less than 10% of periods.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- **2025-09-01** ↑ — Fed signals potential rate hike, increasing market uncertainty.
- **2025-09-10** ↓ — Positive economic data released, easing recession fears.
- **2025-09-12** ↑ — Rising geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe, increasing market risk perception.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Federal Reserve Announcements**: Large impact; rate hikes or dovish stances can significantly move VIX.
- **Economic Data Releases**: Moderate impact; unexpected data can shift market sentiment.
- **Geopolitical Events**: Large impact; sudden escalations can cause sharp VIX increases.
- **Earnings Reports**: Moderate impact; surprises in major companies' earnings can affect volatility.
- **Market Liquidity**: Small to moderate impact; low liquidity can exacerbate VIX movements.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Increased AI Adoption**: May lead to unpredictable market reactions due to new tech-driven sectors.
- **Current Geopolitical Climate**: Higher baseline tension compared to historical norms.
- **Economic Recovery Phase**: Post-pandemic recovery dynamics may alter typical market responses.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a moderate prior for VIX spikes, equivalent n = 20.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Fed rate hike signals — moderate
  - ↓ Positive economic data — small
  - ↑ Geopolitical tensions — large
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move up moderately due to geopolitical risks and Fed signals.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Fed rate hike announcements.
  - Escalation in geopolitical tensions.
  - Negative earnings surprises from major firms.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Continued positive economic data.
  - De-escalation in geopolitical tensions.
  - Strong corporate earnings reports.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Uncertainty in Geopolitical Developments**: Rapid changes can occur without warning.
- **Data Gaps**: Incomplete data on AI's market impact.
- **Deception Risks**: Market manipulation or misinformation can skew VIX.
- **Regime Changes**: Shifts in monetary policy can alter typical VIX responses.
- **Definitional Gotchas**: Misinterpretation of VIX as a direct fear measure rather than a volatility expectation.

Final Research Summary: Expect a moderate increase in VIX due to geopolitical tensions and potential Fed rate hikes, with positive economic data providing some counterbalance.

## Per-model

- **OpenRouter-Default** ok=True time=8813ms cost=$10.9200 parsed={'P10': 1.0, 'P50': 20.0, 'P90': 30.0}

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for the VIX is typically centered around its historical average. Historically, the VIX has an average value of approximately 20, with spikes above 30 being less common and associated with high market stress. The variance is relatively high due to its nature as a volatility index, with a standard deviation around 5-10.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - The current situation is similar to the historical base case in that it involves typical market drivers such as Federal Reserve announcements and geopolitical tensions. However, the geopolitical climate is currently more tense than usual, and there are signals of potential rate hikes, which could lead to a higher VIX than the base case.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Fed rate hike signals increase the likelihood of a higher VIX, as they contribute to market uncertainty. This factor moderately increases the likelihood of higher VIX values.
       - Positive economic data slightly decreases the likelihood of a higher VIX, as it eases recession fears.
       - Rising geopolitical tensions significantly increase the likelihood of a higher VIX, as they heighten market risk perception.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - Starting with a prior centered around a VIX of 20, the evidence of geopolitical tensions and potential rate hikes shifts the distribution upward. The positive economic data provides a slight counterbalance, but the net effect is a moderate increase in the expected VIX level.
       - The posterior distribution is thus centered around a slightly higher mean, with increased variance to account for the heightened uncertainty.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - There is a risk of overestimating the impact of geopolitical tensions if they de-escalate quickly. Conversely, underestimating the impact of a sudden rate hike could lead to underpredicting the VIX spike.
       - An alternative scenario could involve a rapid de-escalation of tensions and continued positive economic data, leading to a lower VIX. However, given the current evidence, the likelihood of this scenario is lower.
       - Adjustments are made to account for these considerations, ensuring the forecast is neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic.
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Based on the analysis, the following percentiles are provided for the maximum intraday value of the VIX during the specified period:
    
    P10: 18  
    P20: 20  
    P40: 23  
    P60: 26

### Reference class & base rates
- **Gold vs. S&P 500 Futures Returns (2010-2025):** Historically, gold futures have outperformed the S&P 500 during periods of economic uncertainty, with average excess returns of 1-2 percentage points (pp) in such periods. Limitations include variability due to geopolitical events and monetary policy changes.
- **Safe-haven Asset Performance:** During financial crises, gold often sees a moderate increase in returns relative to equities, with base rates of 2-3 pp excess returns.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- **2025-09-01** ↑ — U.S. inflation unexpectedly rises, boosting gold's appeal as a hedge.
- **2025-08-15** ↓ — Strong U.S. job growth reported, supporting equities over gold.
- **2025-07-30** ↑ — Geopolitical tensions in Asia escalate, increasing demand for safe-haven assets.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Inflation Rates (moderate):** Higher inflation typically boosts gold as a hedge.
- **Geopolitical Tensions (large):** Heightened tensions can significantly increase gold demand.
- **Central Bank Policies (moderate):** Rate hikes can depress equities, benefiting gold.
- **Economic Data Releases (small):** Positive economic data can favor equities over gold.
- **Currency Fluctuations (moderate):** A weaker dollar often supports gold prices.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Current Inflation Trends:** Inflation is higher than typical, potentially boosting gold more than usual.
- **Geopolitical Climate:** Current tensions are more pronounced, increasing gold's safe-haven appeal.
- **Central Bank Stance:** Recent dovish signals could support equities, contrasting with typical rate hike scenarios.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Gold futures typically outperform S&P 500 by 1-2 pp during uncertainty (equivalent n = 20).
- **Evidence mapping:**
  - ↑ Inflation rise (moderate)
  - ↑ Geopolitical tensions (large)
  - ↓ Strong job growth (small)
- **Net effect:** Posterior should move up moderately, suggesting a higher likelihood of gold outperforming.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
  - Rising inflation reports
  - Escalating geopolitical tensions
  - Central bank dovish policy shifts
- **DOWN indicators:**
  - Strong U.S. economic data
  - De-escalation in geopolitical tensions
  - Hawkish central bank announcements

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Data Volatility:** Economic data can be volatile and subject to revisions.
- **Geopolitical Uncertainty:** Rapid changes can alter market dynamics unpredictably.
- **Policy Shifts:** Unexpected central bank actions can reverse trends.
- **Market Sentiment:** Investor sentiment can shift rapidly, impacting futures.

Final Research Summary: Given current inflation and geopolitical tensions, gold futures are likely to outperform the S&P 500 in the upcoming period. However, strong economic data could mitigate this effect.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the excess returns of Gold Futures over S&P 500 Futures for the period of September 29 to October 10, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - **Base Rate:** Historically, during periods of economic uncertainty, Gold Futures have outperformed S&P 500 Futures by an average of 1-2 percentage points (pp). This is based on data from 2010-2025, where gold is seen as a safe-haven asset.
       - **Mean/Median and Variance:** The mean excess return is approximately 1.5 pp with a variance that reflects moderate variability due to geopolitical and economic factors.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - **Similarities:** Current conditions reflect economic uncertainty with rising inflation and geopolitical tensions, aligning with historical periods where gold outperformed equities.
       - **Differences:** The current geopolitical tensions are more pronounced, and recent dovish central bank signals could support equities, which might slightly counterbalance gold's typical advantage.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - **Inflation Rise:** Increases the likelihood of higher gold returns (moderate impact).
       - **Geopolitical Tensions:** Strongly increases the likelihood of higher gold returns (large impact).
       - **Strong Job Growth:** Slightly decreases the likelihood of higher gold returns (small impact).
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - **Prior:** 1.5 pp excess return with moderate variance.
       - **Likelihood Adjustments:**
         - Inflation and geopolitical tensions suggest a shift upwards.
         - Job growth suggests a slight downward adjustment.
       - **Posterior Mean and Variance:** The posterior mean shifts upwards to approximately 2 pp, with increased variance due to the mixed signals from economic data.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of rapid geopolitical de-escalation or unexpected central bank actions that could favor equities.
       - **Alternative Scenario:** If geopolitical tensions ease, gold's advantage could diminish, leading to a lower excess return.
       - **Adjustment:** Slightly widen the distribution to account for these tail risks.
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Based on the Bayesian update and red team thinking, the following percentiles are provided:
    
    P10: 0.5  
    P20: 1.0  
    P40: 1.5  
    P60: 2.0  
    P80: 2.5  
    P90: 3.0

### Reference class & base rates
- **Crude Oil Futures vs. S&P 500 Futures**: Historically, crude oil futures have shown higher volatility compared to S&P 500 futures. Over the past decade, crude oil futures have outperformed S&P 500 futures in approximately 40% of biweekly periods.
- **Energy Sector vs. Broader Market**: The energy sector, represented by crude oil, often diverges from broader market trends due to geopolitical and supply chain factors.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-09-15] ↑ — China's crude stockpiling suggests strong demand, potentially boosting oil prices.
- [2025-09-15] ↑ — Russian supply risks increase, supporting higher oil prices.
- [2025-09-15] ↓ — RBC Capital predicts choppy S&P 500 action, indicating potential volatility.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Global Demand**: Large — Economic growth or slowdown directly impacts crude oil demand.
- **Geopolitical Tensions**: Moderate — Conflicts or sanctions can disrupt supply, affecting prices.
- **Supply Chain Dynamics**: Moderate — OPEC decisions and production levels influence oil prices.
- **Market Sentiment**: Small — Investor sentiment can drive short-term futures movements.
- **Technological Advances**: Small — Innovations in energy can shift demand away from oil.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **China's Stockpiling**: Unusually high crude imports could sustain elevated prices.
- **Geopolitical Risks**: Heightened tensions in Russia and Ukraine may lead to supply disruptions.
- **S&P 500 Volatility**: Recent predictions of choppy market action could affect futures returns.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a neutral prior with an equivalent n of 20 biweekly periods.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ China's stockpiling (moderate)
  - ↑ Russian supply risks (moderate)
  - ↓ Choppy S&P 500 forecast (small)
- **Net effect**: The posterior should move slightly up, suggesting a moderate increase in the likelihood of crude oil futures outperforming S&P 500 futures.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Increased geopolitical tensions.
  - Continued high crude imports by China.
  - OPEC production cuts.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - De-escalation in geopolitical conflicts.
  - Decrease in global economic growth forecasts.
  - Technological shifts reducing oil dependency.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Uncertainty in Geopolitical Events**: Rapid changes can alter forecasts.
- **Data Gaps**: Incomplete data on global oil inventories.
- **Market Manipulation**: Potential for deceptive practices in futures trading.
- **Regime Changes**: Policy shifts in major economies can impact forecasts.
- **Definitional Gotchas**: Differences in futures contract specifications.

Final Research Summary: Recent geopolitical tensions and China's crude stockpiling suggest a moderate likelihood of crude oil futures outperforming S&P 500 futures in the upcoming biweekly period. However, market volatility and potential geopolitical de-escalation remain key uncertainties.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for the difference in returns between Crude Oil Futures and S&P 500 Futures can be derived from historical data. Over the past decade, crude oil futures have outperformed S&P 500 futures in about 40% of biweekly periods. This suggests a base rate where the mean difference is slightly negative or zero, with a higher variance due to the volatility of crude oil prices.
       - Mean/Median: 0 percentage points (pp)
       - Variance: High, reflecting the volatility of crude oil prices.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: Both Crude Oil and S&P 500 futures are influenced by global economic conditions, but crude oil is more sensitive to geopolitical tensions and supply chain dynamics.
       - Differences: Current geopolitical tensions and China's crude stockpiling are unusual factors that could lead to a divergence from the base rate, potentially favoring crude oil futures.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - China's crude stockpiling suggests increased demand, making higher crude oil returns more likely (moderate upward adjustment).
       - Russian supply risks add to potential price increases for crude oil (moderate upward adjustment).
       - RBC Capital's prediction of choppy S&P 500 action suggests potential volatility, but not necessarily a directional move (small downward adjustment).
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - Prior: Neutral with mean at 0 pp.
       - Likelihood: Moderate upward adjustments from China's stockpiling and Russian supply risks.
       - Posterior: The mean shifts slightly positive, with increased variance due to geopolitical uncertainties.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The geopolitical situation could de-escalate, reducing the upward pressure on crude oil prices.
       - Tail risks: A sudden economic downturn could negatively impact both crude oil and S&P 500 futures.
       - Alternative scenario: If geopolitical tensions ease, the S&P 500 could outperform due to broader market stability.
       - Adjustments: Consider a wider distribution to account for these uncertainties.
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Given the evidence and potential risks, the forecast distribution should reflect a moderate likelihood of crude oil futures outperforming, with a wider spread to account for volatility.
