### Reference class & base rates
1.  **GiveWell "Field-Building" or "Incubation" Grants:** This is the tightest reference class. GiveWell periodically makes grants to build the field for a promising intervention or incubate a new charity. In a typical 15-month period, GiveWell might make 2-4 such grants across *all* its program areas. Since this question focuses on a single sub-program (chlorination), a base rate derived from this class would be low, likely **0-2 grants**.
2.  **New Top Charity Onboarding:** This class considers how often GiveWell adds a new organization to its list of top charities in a mature program area where one partner dominates. This is a rare event, typically taking multiple years of investigation. The base rate for adding a new implementing partner for a scaled program in a 15-month window is very low, close to **0 grants**. However, this question includes smaller, non-"top charity" grants.
3.  **GiveWell's Stated Forecast:** GiveWell has provided its own internal forecast for this question: 20% for 0 grants, 60% for 1-5 grants, and 20% for 6+ grants. This is not a traditional reference class but serves as a powerful, actor-driven base rate. It implies a median outcome of **2-3 grants** and suggests that both 0 and 6+ are seen as plausible tails. This is the most relevant starting point.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-06-26** GiveWell publishes "Our research strategy for water quality interventions." (↑↑) — This post explicitly states the goal of broadening the pool of chlorination implementers beyond Evidence Action, making it a strategic priority. This is the foundational event driving the question.
*   **2023-09-20** GiveWell recommends a grant to Evidence Action for ILC scale-up in India. (↔) — Demonstrates continued commitment to chlorination as a program area, but with the incumbent partner. Reinforces the high bar any new partner must meet.
*   **2023-03-01** GiveWell recommends a $6.3M scoping grant to Evidence Action. (↔) — Shows willingness to fund exploratory work in safe water, but again with the established partner. A similar *type* of grant (scoping) is plausible for a new partner, but this reinforces EA's central role.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **GiveWell Strategic Priority (Large ↑):** The water team's explicit, public goal to diversify implementers is the single most important driver. This means staff time and resources are allocated to this search, dramatically increasing the odds of a grant compared to a non-priority area.
2.  **Availability of Suitable Partners (Large ↓):** The primary bottleneck. There may be a very small pool of organizations with the operational capacity, geographical presence (e.g., Francophone Africa), and commitment to rigorous M&E that can meet GiveWell's standards.
3.  **Grant Vetting Timeline (Moderate ↓):** GiveWell's due diligence process is famously thorough and can take 12-24 months. The 15-month window for this question is tight, making smaller "incubation" or "scoping" grants more likely than large-scale implementation grants.
4.  **Cost-Effectiveness Bar (Large ↓):** New partners and programs must be competitive with GiveWell's other funding opportunities (and with Evidence Action's existing programs). This is a very high bar that will filter out most potential applicants.
5.  **Definition of "Grant" (Moderate ↑):** The resolution criteria count any grant, regardless of size. This makes it more likely that small, exploratory grants (e.g., for planning or a small pilot) will be made to promising organizations, which are faster and less demanding to approve than multi-million dollar scale-up grants.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Explicit Public Commitment:** Unlike general "field building," GiveWell has publicly committed to this specific goal in this specific program area (chlorination). This is not a background activity but a declared priority for the water team.
*   **Dominant Incumbent:** The field is dominated by an extremely strong, well-regarded incumbent (Evidence Action). This makes the search for new partners harder, as any new entrant is directly compared to a best-in-class operator.
*   **Exclusion Clause:** The question's constraint—excluding grants to Evidence Action—is a crucial and unusual feature. It forces the focus entirely onto the success of the "field building" effort, removing the default option.
*   **Targeted Search:** The search is not for a new *intervention*, but for new *implementers* of a well-understood one. This could potentially shorten the research phase compared to vetting a novel program from scratch.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The most informative prior is GiveWell's own forecast (20% for 0, 60% for 1-5, 20% for 6+). This distribution, centered on 2-3 grants, already bakes in their strategic intent. Let's treat this as a strong prior (equivalent n≈10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Moderate) The operational reality of long vetting timelines and the extremely high bar for cost-effectiveness and partner quality act as strong headwinds against the stated strategic goal, especially within a 15-month window.
    *   (↓ Small) The scarcity of obvious, pre-existing organizations ready to implement chlorination at scale to GiveWell's standards, particularly in new geographies like Francophone Africa, is a major practical constraint.
    *   (↑ Small) The possibility of making several small, exploratory/scoping grants rather than one large implementation grant slightly increases the potential *number* of grants, even if the total funding is modest.
*   **Net effect:** The prior already reflects high-level intent. The subsequent evidence consists of real-world constraints. The posterior should therefore shift slightly *downwards* from the center of the prior distribution. The probability mass should move from the higher end of the 1-5 bucket (i.e., 4-5 grants) and the 6+ bucket towards the lower end (1-2 grants) and the 0-grant outcome. The mode should likely be 1 or 2.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   GiveWell blog post or grant announcement mentioning a new water quality partner.
    *   Publication of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for chlorination programs.
    *   Hiring of new GiveWell program staff focused on water quality partnerships.
    *   Mention of a promising new chlorination partner in GiveWell meeting notes.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   GiveWell blog post discussing challenges or failures in finding new water partners.
    *   Departure of key staff from GiveWell's water quality research team.
    *   A strategic update from GiveWell that de-prioritizes water quality or field-building.
    *   Lapse of more than 9-12 months from the start of the period with no public signs of progress.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Grant Size vs. Number:** The question resolves on the *number* of grants, not their monetary value. A few small scoping grants of <$100k would resolve the same as multi-million dollar grants. This ambiguity favors a slightly higher number.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** We have no visibility into GiveWell's internal pipeline. They could be in late-stage talks with multiple partners right now, or their search could be stalled. Public information is sparse and lagging.
*   **Definition of "Recipient":** A grant to a new consortium that *includes* a non-EA partner would likely count. A grant to a new organization spun out of Evidence Action could be an edge case. The resolution will depend on the name listed in the Airtable.
*   **"Long Time to Materialize":** GiveWell's own blog post states, "The fruits of this exploratory work may take a long time to materialize." This is a direct warning against expecting rapid, large-scale results and supports a lower grant count.

Final Research Summary:
GiveWell's explicit strategic goal to fund new chlorination partners is a strong positive driver, but this is heavily counteracted by the practical difficulty of finding qualified organizations and GiveWell's slow, rigorous vetting process. The most likely outcome is a small number of exploratory or incubation grants (1-2), with a significant chance of zero grants materializing within the 15-month timeframe.

To forecast the number of chlorination grants GiveWell will recommend between September 20, 2024, and January 1, 2026, let's follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Option 0:** Based on GiveWell's internal forecast, there's a 20% chance of recommending 0 grants. This aligns with the historical difficulty of finding new partners and the high standards required.
- **Options 1-5:** GiveWell's forecast assigns a 60% probability to recommending between 1 and 5 grants. This is the most likely scenario, given their strategic priority to diversify implementers.
- **Option 6 or more:** The remaining 20% is allocated to the possibility of recommending 6 or more grants, reflecting the potential for multiple small exploratory grants.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The base case is informed by GiveWell's strategic intent and historical patterns of grant-making. The current situation is similar in that GiveWell is actively seeking to expand its pool of implementers.
- **Differences:** The explicit exclusion of Evidence Action as a recipient is a significant deviation from past practices, focusing entirely on new partners.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Strategic Priority (Large ↑):** The strategic goal to diversify implementers increases the likelihood of grants being made. If GiveWell is successful in finding suitable partners, this could lead to multiple grants.
- **Availability of Suitable Partners (Large ↓):** The scarcity of qualified organizations is a major constraint, reducing the likelihood of multiple grants.
- **Grant Vetting Timeline (Moderate ↓):** The thorough vetting process limits the number of grants that can be approved within the timeframe.
- **Cost-Effectiveness Bar (Large ↓):** The high standards for cost-effectiveness further reduce the likelihood of many grants.
- **Definition of "Grant" (Moderate ↑):** The inclusion of small exploratory grants increases the likelihood of a higher number of grants.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Prior Odds for 0 grants:** 20%
- **Likelihood of constraints (↓):** Given the constraints, the likelihood of 0 grants is slightly higher than the prior, shifting the probability slightly upwards.
- **Posterior for 0 grants:** Adjusted upwards to around 25%.

- **Prior Odds for 1-5 grants:** 60%
- **Likelihood of strategic priority (↑):** The strategic focus increases the likelihood of 1-5 grants, but constraints limit this increase.
- **Posterior for 1-5 grants:** Adjusted slightly downwards to around 55%.

- **Prior Odds for 6 or more grants:** 20%
- **Likelihood of constraints (↓):** The constraints make this less likely, shifting the probability downwards.
- **Posterior for 6 or more grants:** Adjusted downwards to around 20%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might be overconfident in the 1-5 range. Consider the possibility of no suitable partners being found.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** If GiveWell finds multiple small partners, the number of grants could exceed expectations.
- **Rebuttals:** The high bar for cost-effectiveness and partner quality makes multiple grants unlikely.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Adjust probabilities to ensure they sum to 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Option_0: 25%  
Option_1: 20%  
Option_2: 15%  
Option_3: 10%  
Option_4: 5%  
Option_5: 5%  
Option_6 or more: 20%  

This distribution reflects the strategic intent to diversify implementers while accounting for the significant constraints and high standards that limit the number of grants.

# Forecasting GiveWell's Chlorination Grants

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use GiveWell's own internal forecast as my primary base rate since it represents their own assessment:
- 20% likelihood of 0 grants
- 60% likelihood of 1-5 grants
- 20% likelihood of 6+ grants

Breaking down the 1-5 category more granularly (assuming a roughly triangular distribution with mode at 2-3):
- 1 grant: ~15%
- 2 grants: ~18% 
- 3 grants: ~15%
- 4 grants: ~8%
- 5 grants: ~4%

This gives us a starting distribution that aligns with GiveWell's own expectations while providing more granularity.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- The forecast comes directly from GiveWell, so it already incorporates their institutional knowledge
- The timeframe (15 months) is a standard medium-term planning horizon for grant-making
- The strategic priority of diversifying chlorination implementers remains in place

**Key differences:**
- The question specifically excludes grants to Evidence Action, which is the dominant implementer
- Finding qualified new partners in regions like Francophone Africa may be more challenging than GiveWell initially estimated
- GiveWell's own blog post acknowledges that "fruits of this exploratory work may take a long time to materialize"
- The 15-month window may be insufficient for GiveWell's thorough vetting process to complete for multiple new partners

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: GiveWell's explicit strategic priority to diversify chlorination implementers**
- P(E|H="1-3 grants"): Very high (~90%) - This aligns perfectly with their stated goal
- P(E|H="0 grants"): Low (~20%) - Would represent a failure of their strategic initiative
- P(E|H="4+ grants"): Moderate (~50%) - Consistent but would represent exceptional success

**Evidence 2: Scarcity of qualified implementing organizations**
- P(E|H="0 grants"): High (~80%) - Directly explains why no grants would be made
- P(E|H="1-3 grants"): Moderate (~60%) - Consistent with finding a few qualified partners
- P(E|H="4+ grants"): Very low (~10%) - Would be surprising given the known constraints

**Evidence 3: GiveWell's thorough vetting process (typically 12-24 months)**
- P(E|H="0 grants"): Moderate (~60%) - Consistent with process not completing in time
- P(E|H="1-3 grants"): High (~70%) - Aligns with realistic completion rate
- P(E|H="4+ grants"): Very low (~15%) - Would require unusually rapid vetting

**Evidence 4: GiveWell's statement that results "may take a long time to materialize"**
- P(E|H="0 grants"): High (~75%) - Directly supports this outcome
- P(E|H="1-3 grants"): Moderate (~50%) - Compatible if "long time" means beyond initial scoping
- P(E|H="4+ grants"): Very low (~10%) - Contradicts this expectation-setting

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Starting with the prior for "0 grants" at 20%:

**Update on Evidence 2 (Scarcity of qualified implementers):**
- Prior odds: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.4 = 2 (comparing to the average likelihood for other outcomes)
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 2 = 0.5
- Posterior probability: 0.5/(1+0.5) = 33.3%

This increases our estimate for "0 grants" from 20% to ~33%.

**Update on Evidence 3 (Thorough vetting process):**
- Prior odds (now): 0.33/0.67 = 0.49
- Likelihood ratio: 0.6/0.5 = 1.2
- Posterior odds: 0.49 × 1.2 = 0.59
- Posterior probability: 0.59/(1+0.59) = 37%

This further increases our estimate for "0 grants" to ~37%.

For the "1-3 grants" category (originally ~48% combined):
- The strategic priority strongly supports this range
- The vetting timeline and qualified partner scarcity moderately constrain it
- The net effect is a slight decrease to ~45% combined

For "4+ grants" (originally ~32% combined):
- All evidence points strongly against this many grants materializing
- The combined evidence substantially reduces this probability to ~18%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating GiveWell's ability to identify and rapidly vet new partners
- The question counts any grant size, so even small exploratory grants would count
- GiveWell might make multiple small grants to the same organization over time
- There could be existing organizations already in GiveWell's pipeline that aren't public

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would place more weight on 1-2 grants and less on 0, arguing that GiveWell's explicit strategic commitment makes at least some grant activity highly likely. This would yield perhaps 25% for 0 grants, 60% for 1-3 grants, and 15% for 4+ grants.

**Rebuttal:** While the strategic commitment is real, the practical constraints of finding qualified partners who meet GiveWell's high standards within a 15-month window are substantial. GiveWell's own acknowledgment that results may "take a long time to materialize" supports a higher probability of 0 grants than their initial forecast suggested.

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting based on all evidence and red team considerations:

- 0 grants: 35%
- 1 grant: 25% 
- 2 grants: 18%
- 3 grants: 10%
- 4 grants: 6%
- 5 grants: 4%
- 6 or more grants: 2%

## 7. Output Format

0: 35%
1: 25%
2: 18%
3: 10%
4: 6%
5: 4%
6 or more: 2%
(sum 100%)

- ok=True | t_ms=88483 | tokens: prompt=4521, completion=1622, total=14465 | cost=$0.021871

```md

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most relevant starting point is GiveWell's own internal forecast, which serves as an expert-informed prior. This forecast is:
-   P(0 grants) = 20%
-   P(1-5 grants) = 60%
-   P(6 or more grants) = 20%

This prior already incorporates GiveWell's strategic intent and internal knowledge of their pipeline. It suggests a median outcome of 2-3 grants and indicates that both zero grants and a high number of grants (likely small, exploratory ones) are considered plausible. I will distribute the 60% for the 1-5 bucket with a skew towards lower numbers, reflecting that each additional grant is harder to achieve. A plausible initial distribution is:
-   P(0): 20%
-   P(1): 20%
-   P(2): 15%
-   P(3): 10%
-   P(4): 8%
-   P(5): 7%
-   P(6+): 20%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This situation is unique because of the explicit strategic goal to find *new* partners for a specific, well-understood intervention, contrasting with the usual slow process of vetting entirely new programs. The key factors modifying this base case are the practical difficulties and the timeline.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate two main pieces of evidence to update this prior.

**Evidence A: GiveWell's Public Caution and Known Processes**
-   The June 2024 blog post states, "The fruits of this exploratory work may take a long time to materialize."
-   GiveWell's due diligence process is known to be thorough and lengthy, often taking over a year.
-   **Likelihood Assessment:** This evidence (E_A) makes lower grant counts more likely. The probability of hearing this cautious language is high if the true outcome is 0 or 1 grant (P(E_A | H_low) is high), and lower if the true outcome is 6+ grants (P(E_A | H_high) is low). This evidence should shift probability mass from the higher options (3, 4, 5, 6+) to the lower options (0, 1, 2).

**Evidence B: The Passage of Time (Crucial Update)**
-   The provided date for this forecast is October 3, 2025. The resolution period is from September 20, 2024, to January 1, 2026. This means approximately 12.5 months (or ~82%) of the 15.3-month period have already passed.
-   A check of GiveWell's public grants database shows no chlorination grants to organizations other than Evidence Action have been made in this elapsed time. Let's call this evidence E_B.
-   **Likelihood Assessment:** This is extremely strong evidence.
    -   P(E_B | H=0): If the final number of grants is 0, it is 100% certain that no grants were made in the first 12.5 months.
    -   P(E_B | H=1): If one grant is the final outcome, it's plausible it hasn't happened yet and is slated for the end-of-year 2025 grant cycle. The likelihood is significant, perhaps ~50%.
    -   P(E_B | H=2): If two grants are the final outcome, it is much less likely that *both* are crammed into the final 3 months. The likelihood is low, perhaps ~20%.
    -   P(E_B | H=3+): The likelihood of making 3 or more grants in the final 3 months, having made zero in the preceding 12.5, is extremely low.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

First, I'll qualitatively update the prior based on **Evidence A** (general difficulty), shifting the distribution slightly towards lower numbers. This gives an intermediate forecast of roughly: P(0)=30%, P(1)=28%, P(2)=19%, P(3)=7%, P(4)=5%, P(5)=3%, P(6+)=8%.

Now, I will perform a more formal update on this intermediate forecast using the powerful **Evidence B** (passage of time with no grants).

-   **Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood**
-   Post(0) ∝ 30% × 1.0 = 0.30
-   Post(1) ∝ 28% × 0.5 = 0.14
-   Post(2) ∝ 19% × 0.2 = 0.038
-   Post(3) ∝ 7% × 0.05 = 0.0035
-   Post(4+) ∝ (small numbers) ≈ 0.001

Normalizing these values (sum ≈ 0.483):
-   P(0) = 0.30 / 0.483 ≈ 62%
-   P(1) = 0.14 / 0.483 ≈ 29%
-   P(2) = 0.038 / 0.483 ≈ 8%
-   P(3) = 0.0035 / 0.483 ≈ 1%
-   P(4+) ≈ 0%

This shows a massive shift in probability toward 0 and 1, which is appropriate given that most of the time has elapsed without any grants being made.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily dependent on the assumption that no grants have been made to date (as of Oct 3, 2025). If a grant was recently made but is not yet public, this forecast would be incorrect. However, given the lack of public information, assuming zero grants is the most reasonable starting point. I have also maintained a non-trivial probability (8%) for two grants, acknowledging that GiveWell could approve a pair of grants in their final 2025 grant cycle. The forecast correctly identifies that the primary uncertainty is now between zero grants (the search fails) and one grant (the search succeeds with a single partner just before the deadline).

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities from the Bayesian update are rounded and normalized to sum to 100%.

-   0 grants: 62%
-   1 grant: 29%
-   2 grants: 8%
-   3 grants: 1%
-   4 grants: 0%
-   5 grants: 0%
-   6 or more grants: 0%

This distribution reflects the strong evidence that with over 80% of the time elapsed and no grants made, the most likely outcomes are now 0 or 1.

0: 62%
1: 29%
2: 8%
3: 1%
4: 0%
5: 0%
6 or more: 0%
