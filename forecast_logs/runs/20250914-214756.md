### Reference class & base rates
- **European Stock Indices**: Historically, major European indices have shown annual growth rates of 5-10%. However, volatility can be high due to economic and political factors.
- **Spanish Economic Growth**: Spain's GDP growth has averaged around 2-3% annually over the past decade, influencing the IBEX 35.
- **IBEX 35 Historical Performance**: The index has experienced annual fluctuations, with some years seeing double-digit growth or decline.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-09-01] ↑ — Spain's GDP growth forecast revised upward, indicating stronger economic fundamentals.
- [2025-08-15] ↓ — ECB signals potential interest rate hikes, which could dampen stock market enthusiasm.
- [2025-07-20] ↑ — Positive earnings reports from major IBEX 35 companies boost investor confidence.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Economic Growth**: Moderate impact; stronger GDP growth can drive stock market gains.
- **Monetary Policy**: Large impact; ECB interest rate decisions significantly influence market sentiment.
- **Corporate Earnings**: Moderate impact; strong earnings reports can boost stock prices.
- **Political Stability**: Small impact; political uncertainty can lead to market volatility.
- **Global Market Trends**: Large impact; global economic conditions and trends affect investor behavior.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Recent Strong Performance**: The IBEX 35 has outperformed many European indices recently, suggesting momentum.
- **Economic Resilience**: Spain's economy has shown resilience despite global uncertainties.
- **Interest Rate Environment**: Potential ECB rate hikes could pose a headwind not present in previous years.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a moderate probability of the IBEX 35 closing higher, equivalent to a 60% chance based on historical growth.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Moderate: Strong recent performance and positive economic indicators.
  - ↓ Large: Potential ECB interest rate hikes.
  - ↑ Small: Positive corporate earnings reports.
- **Net effect**: The posterior should slightly increase due to strong recent performance, but tempered by interest rate concerns.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Continued GDP growth revisions upward.
  - Positive earnings surprises from major IBEX 35 companies.
  - Stabilization or reduction in ECB interest rate hike expectations.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - ECB signaling more aggressive rate hikes.
  - Negative geopolitical developments affecting Europe.
  - Deterioration in global economic conditions.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Economic Forecast Uncertainty**: GDP forecasts can change rapidly.
- **Interest Rate Volatility**: ECB policy shifts can be unpredictable.
- **Global Market Influence**: External shocks can impact the IBEX 35 unexpectedly.
- **Data Gaps**: Limited real-time data on economic indicators.
- **Regime Changes**: Political shifts in Spain or the EU could alter market dynamics.

Final Research Summary: The IBEX 35 has shown strong recent performance, supported by economic growth and corporate earnings. However, potential ECB interest rate hikes pose a significant risk. The probability of the index closing higher in 2025 should be slightly increased, with close monitoring of economic and monetary policy developments.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast whether the IBEX 35 will close 2025 higher than it started, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Base Rate**: Historically, major European stock indices, including the IBEX 35, have shown annual growth rates of 5-10%. Given the recent strong performance of the IBEX 35, a reasonable base rate for the index closing higher than it started is around 60%. This reflects both historical growth and recent momentum.
    - **Initial Prior**: 60% probability that the IBEX 35 will close higher.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarities**: The IBEX 35 has shown strong growth in recent years, aligning with historical trends of stock market growth.
    - **Differences**: The potential for ECB interest rate hikes is a significant factor that could negatively impact the market, which is not always present in historical contexts.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **Strong Recent Performance**: The IBEX 35 has been one of the top-performing indices in Europe, suggesting positive momentum. This increases the likelihood of the index closing higher.
      - **Likelihood Ratio**: Moderate increase (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)).
    - **Economic Growth**: Upward revisions in Spain's GDP growth forecast support a positive outlook for the IBEX 35.
      - **Likelihood Ratio**: Moderate increase.
    - **ECB Interest Rate Hikes**: The potential for rate hikes could dampen market enthusiasm, posing a significant risk.
      - **Likelihood Ratio**: Large decrease (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)).
    - **Positive Corporate Earnings**: Recent positive earnings reports from major companies in the index boost confidence.
      - **Likelihood Ratio**: Small increase.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    - **Prior Odds**: 60% probability translates to odds of 3:2.
    - **Net Evidence Impact**: The positive momentum and economic growth slightly outweigh the negative impact of potential interest rate hikes.
    - **Posterior Odds Calculation**: Adjusting the prior odds with the net evidence impact results in slightly increased odds.
    - **Posterior Probability**: Approximately 65%.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: The forecast should account for the uncertainty in ECB policy and global market conditions.
    - **Alternative Scenarios**: Consider scenarios where global economic downturns or geopolitical tensions could negatively impact the IBEX 35.
    - **Adjustment**: Given these considerations, a slight downward adjustment from the initial posterior probability is prudent.
    
    ### 6. Final Forecast
    - **Final Probability**: After considering all evidence and potential risks, the final probability that the IBEX 35 will close 2025 higher than it started is 63%.
    
    Final: 63%
