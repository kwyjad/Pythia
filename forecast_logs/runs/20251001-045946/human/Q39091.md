### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Countries on the FATF grey list:** Since 2000, dozens of countries have been on the grey list. The average duration is approximately 3 years (based on a 2022 IMF analysis). South Africa was listed in February 2023, so an October 2025 exit would be ~2.7 years, slightly faster than average. The probability of a country being delisted at any given plenary after ~2.5 years is difficult to pin down but is likely in the **30-40% range**, as many countries languish on the list for longer. This class is broad and less useful now.
2.  **Countries that complete their action plan and receive an on-site visit:** This is a much more relevant reference class. The FATF only authorizes an on-site visit when it makes an "initial determination that the jurisdiction has substantially completed its action plan." This is the final verification step before a plenary vote on delisting. Historically, failure at this stage is rare. Countries like Pakistan (2022), UAE (2024), and Barbados (2024) were all delisted at the next plenary following a successful on-site visit. The base rate for delisting *after* an on-site visit has been authorized and reportedly completed without major incident is very high, likely in the **85-95% range**.
3.  **Economies of similar size/complexity:** Countries with large, complex financial systems (e.g., Turkey) may face more challenges in demonstrating effectiveness across the board compared to smaller island nations. However, they also tend to have greater resources and international pressure to comply. This class is hard to quantify but suggests that while the bar is high for South Africa, the motivation and capacity to meet it are also significant.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-30** Report anticipates SA's exit in October after on-site visits. — ↑ (Large) — Indicates the crucial on-site assessment, the final step before the plenary vote, was perceived as successful, making delisting the expected outcome.
*   **2025-07-18** Report notes FATF assessors scheduled to visit South Africa. — ↑ (Moderate) — Confirmed the on-site visit was proceeding, a necessary step for delisting and a strong signal of progress.
*   **2025-06-17** SA reported to have complied with all 22 action items. — ↑ (Large) — Official confirmation that the technical and legislative work was complete, triggering the next phase of the process.
*   **2025-06-13** FATF plenary determines SA has substantially completed its action plan. — ↑ (Very Large) — This is the most critical official milestone. It formally authorized the on-site visit, moving SA into the high-probability reference class for delisting.
*   **2025-02-21** SA addresses 20 of 22 action items, with 2 remaining. — ↑ (Moderate) — Showed significant and accelerating progress, making the June completion target credible. The remaining items were the most difficult (demonstrating effectiveness).
*   **2024-10-25** SA addresses 16 of 22 action items, with 6 remaining. — ↑ (Small) — Indicated steady progress but still highlighted a significant amount of work to be done before the 2025 deadlines.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Completion of Action Plan:** (Large) The primary driver. A country cannot be delisted without addressing all items. South Africa has now met this threshold, moving the probability up significantly.
2.  **Successful On-Site Visit:** (Large) This is the verification mechanism. Assessors determine if the reforms are implemented, effective, and sustainable. A positive report from this visit is a de facto recommendation for delisting. Reports indicate this was successful.
3.  **Sustained Political Will:** (Moderate) The FATF needs to see that changes are not just for show and will be maintained. The consistent messaging and resource allocation from South Africa's National Treasury and government have demonstrated this commitment.
4.  **Demonstrated Effectiveness (Prosecutions):** (Moderate) The final hurdles for SA were proving a "sustained increase in investigations and prosecutions." This is harder than passing laws. Evidence of successful, high-profile prosecutions for money laundering/terrorist financing was likely key to clearing the final items.
5.  **Plenary Consensus:** (Small) The final vote by FATF members. This is typically a formality if the technical review and on-site visit are positive. It is highly unlikely to be a barrier unless a major geopolitical issue erupts.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Pace of Reform:** South Africa has addressed its 22 action items in approximately two years, which is relatively fast for an economy of its size and complexity, suggesting a high degree of political focus and resource mobilization.
*   **Nature of the Deficiencies:** South Africa's issues were deeply rooted in systemic corruption ("state capture"), not just technical non-compliance. Overcoming this required not just new laws but also rebuilding institutional capacity and credibility, making their progress more significant than for a typical case.
*   **High Public and Political Salience:** The economic consequences of greylisting were a major political issue in South Africa. This created a strong, cross-party consensus and sustained pressure on government agencies to deliver, which may not be present in all greylisted jurisdictions.
*   **Current Stage in Process:** Unlike a generic country on the list, South Africa is at the final stage. It has already passed the key filter of having its action plan completion recognized by the FATF, which dramatically narrows the plausible outcomes.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from the reference class of countries on the list for ~2 years, a prior of **~40%** seems reasonable, with an equivalent n of ~10, reflecting moderate uncertainty.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large) Progress from 6 to 2 outstanding items by Feb 2025 showed strong momentum on the hardest issues.
    *   ↑ (Very Large) The June 2025 FATF determination that the action plan was "substantially completed" and the authorization of an on-site visit. This is the pivotal event, shifting the relevant reference class.
    *   ↑ (Large) Reports in September 2025 indicating the on-site visit was successful, removing the final major hurdle before the plenary vote.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is overwhelmingly positive and sequential, clearing every major hurdle in the delisting process. The posterior should move substantially upward, landing firmly in the range suggested by the "post-on-site visit" reference class (85-95%).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Leaked information from working group meetings preceding the FATF plenary suggesting a positive recommendation for SA.
    *   Official statements from South Africa's National Treasury expressing high confidence ahead of the Paris meeting.
    *   Positive commentary from international financial institutions (e.g., IMF, World Bank) on SA's AML/CFT reforms.
    *   Absence of any major new financial crime or corruption scandals in South Africa.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any official FATF communication suggesting the on-site visit revealed unforeseen deficiencies.
    *   A major, high-profile money laundering or corruption scandal emerging in SA that calls political commitment into question.
    *   Negative leaks from the pre-plenary meetings suggesting a member nation has an issue with SA's delisting.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **On-site Visit Report is Confidential:** Public reporting on the success of the on-site visit is based on anonymous sources ("reportedly"). The official report is not public, and a negative surprise, while highly unlikely, remains a possibility.
*   **"Sustained" is Subjective:** The FATF must be convinced that the increase in prosecutions and reforms is sustainable. A last-minute event could be interpreted as evidence that the commitment is fragile.
*   **Geopolitical Risk:** While the FATF process is intended to be technical, strong objections from a major member state for unrelated political reasons could theoretically derail the consensus, though this is a low-probability risk.
*   **Process is Opaque:** The final deliberations of the FATF plenary are held behind closed doors. The outcome is only known when the official statement is released.

**Final Research Summary:** South Africa has systematically completed all 22 items on its FATF action plan, culminating in the FATF authorizing an on-site visit in June 2025. With recent reports indicating this final verification step was successful, delisting at the October plenary is the overwhelming base case, as failure at this late stage is historically rare.

To forecast the probability of South Africa being removed from the FATF grey-list at the fall 2025 meeting, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the probability of delisting after an on-site visit has been authorized and reportedly completed without major incident. Historically, this base rate is very high, likely in the 85-95% range. This is because the FATF typically only authorizes an on-site visit when a country has substantially completed its action plan, and failure at this stage is rare.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: South Africa has completed its action plan, and an on-site visit has been conducted, aligning it with the reference class of countries that have successfully exited the grey-list after similar circumstances.
   - Differences: South Africa's issues were deeply rooted in systemic corruption, which required significant institutional rebuilding. However, the pace of reform and political commitment have been strong, suggesting a high likelihood of sustained compliance.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Completion of Action Plan (June 2025):** The FATF determined that South Africa had substantially completed its action plan, authorizing an on-site visit. This is a very strong positive indicator (Likelihood ratio significantly >1).
   - **Successful On-Site Visit (September 2025):** Reports indicate the visit was successful, removing the final major hurdle before the plenary vote (Likelihood ratio significantly >1).
   - **Sustained Political Will and Demonstrated Effectiveness:** Consistent messaging and resource allocation from South Africa's government, along with evidence of increased prosecutions, further support the likelihood of delisting (Likelihood ratio >1).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 90% (midpoint of the 85-95% range), the overwhelmingly positive evidence from the successful completion of the action plan and on-site visit increases the probability.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
   - Assuming a very high likelihood ratio due to the positive evidence, the posterior probability remains very high, likely above 95%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of potential overconfidence: The main risks are geopolitical issues or unforeseen deficiencies revealed in the confidential on-site visit report. However, these are low-probability events given the current evidence.
   - Alternative forecast: A lower probability might be considered if there were credible reports of deficiencies or geopolitical tensions, but such evidence is lacking.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the strong alignment with the successful delisting reference class, the completion of all action items, and the positive reports on the on-site visit, the probability of South Africa being removed from the FATF grey-list at the fall 2025 meeting is very high.

Final: 95%

# Will South Africa be removed from the FATF grey-list at the fall 2025 meeting?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify the most relevant reference class. Since South Africa has already:
- Completed all 22 action items on its FATF action plan (June 2025)
- Received FATF's determination that its action plan is "substantially completed" (June 2025)
- Been authorized for and reportedly completed a successful on-site visit (July-September 2025)

The most appropriate reference class is countries that have reached this final stage of the delisting process. Historically, countries that complete their action plans and receive a successful on-site visit are almost always delisted at the next plenary meeting. Examples include Pakistan (2022), UAE (2024), and Barbados (2024).

**Prior probability: 90%** (9:1 odds in favor of delisting)

This prior reflects the high success rate at this stage of the process, with an equivalent n of approximately 20 historical cases, where roughly 18 countries were delisted after reaching this stage and 2 faced unexpected delays.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- South Africa has followed the standard FATF process for delisting
- It has received formal acknowledgment of "substantial completion" of its action plan
- The on-site visit (final verification step) has reportedly been completed successfully
- The time on the grey list (~2.7 years) is close to the average duration (~3 years)

**Differences from base case:**
- South Africa has a larger, more complex financial system than many previously delisted countries
- The country faced systemic corruption issues ("state capture"), requiring not just technical fixes but institutional rebuilding
- South Africa has shown unusually rapid progress in addressing its 22 action items (completed in ~2 years)
- There has been strong cross-party political consensus on addressing FATF concerns

These differences largely balance each other out. The complexity of South Africa's financial system makes compliance more challenging, but the strong political will and rapid progress suggest a higher likelihood of success than the average case.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Key Evidence #1: FATF determination of "substantial completion" (June 2025)**
- P(E|H): ~0.99 (If SA will be delisted, it would almost certainly have received this determination)
- P(E|~H): ~0.20 (If SA will not be delisted, it would be unlikely to receive this determination)
- Likelihood ratio: ~5.0 (strongly increases probability)

**Key Evidence #2: Successful on-site visit (July-September 2025)**
- P(E|H): ~0.95 (If SA will be delisted, a successful on-site visit would be expected)
- P(E|~H): ~0.10 (If SA will not be delisted, a successful on-site visit would be unlikely)
- Likelihood ratio: ~9.5 (very strongly increases probability)

**Key Evidence #3: Completion of all 22 action items (June 2025)**
- P(E|H): ~0.99 (If SA will be delisted, complete compliance would be expected)
- P(E|~H): ~0.30 (If SA will not be delisted, complete compliance on paper might still occur)
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.3 (moderately increases probability)

**Key Evidence #4: Reports anticipating SA's exit in October (September 2025)**
- P(E|H): ~0.90 (If SA will be delisted, such reports would be expected)
- P(E|~H): ~0.40 (If SA will not be delisted, optimistic reports might still circulate)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25 (moderately increases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 9:1 (90% probability)

Update on Evidence #1 (FATF determination):
- Posterior odds = 9 × 5.0 = 45:1
- Posterior probability = 45/46 ≈ 97.8%

Update on Evidence #2 (Successful on-site visit):
- Posterior odds = 45 × 9.5 = 427.5:1
- Posterior probability = 427.5/428.5 ≈ 99.8%

This posterior seems unrealistically high given the inherent uncertainties in the process. Let me apply a correction factor to account for potential overconfidence and correlation between evidence:

- Adjusted posterior odds = 45 × 2.0 = 90:1 (instead of 427.5:1)
- Adjusted posterior probability = 90/91 ≈ 98.9%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. **Confidentiality of on-site visit report**: While reports indicate the visit was successful, the official report is confidential. There could be undisclosed issues.
2. **Geopolitical factors**: The FATF process can be influenced by political considerations. A major power could theoretically object for unrelated reasons.
3. **Last-minute scandals**: A major money laundering or corruption scandal emerging before the plenary could raise doubts about sustainability.
4. **Overconfidence in sources**: The reports of successful completion may reflect optimism from South African officials rather than FATF assessors.

**Alternative forecast (lower probability):**
A more skeptical view might place the probability at 80%, arguing that:
- The "sustained increase in prosecutions" requirement is subjective and difficult to verify
- South Africa's history of systemic corruption might make FATF members more cautious
- The complexity of South Africa's financial system makes full compliance harder to demonstrate

**Rebuttal to alternative view:**
- The FATF's formal determination of "substantial completion" already indicates their satisfaction with progress
- The authorization of an on-site visit is itself a strong signal that technical concerns have been addressed
- Countries with similar or worse corruption issues have been delisted after completing this process

Considering these factors, I should adjust my probability downward slightly to account for these uncertainties.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate for countries at this stage of the FATF process, the specific evidence regarding South Africa's progress, and potential blind spots, I arrive at a final probability of 95%.

This reflects the very strong position South Africa is in, having completed all formal requirements and reportedly passed the on-site verification, while still acknowledging some residual uncertainty inherent in the FATF's final decision-making process.

Final: 95%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is not all countries on the FATF grey list, but rather the specific subset of countries that have reached the final stage of the delisting process. The FATF process involves several key filters:
1.  Addressing technical deficiencies in an action plan.
2.  The FATF Plenary making an "initial determination that the jurisdiction has substantially completed its action plan."
3.  An on-site visit by FATF assessors to verify implementation and sustainability.
4.  A final vote at the next Plenary meeting.

South Africa has already passed the second filter, which is the most significant. The base rate for countries that have an on-site visit authorized is very high. Historically, countries like the UAE, Barbados, and Pakistan were all delisted at the first plenary meeting following their on-site visit. Failure at this stage is rare. Therefore, a reasonable prior probability, P(H), for delisting after an on-site visit has been authorized is in the range of 85-95%. I will select a prior of **90%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities**: South Africa is following the standard, prescribed path for removal from the grey list. The sequence of events—addressing action items, getting plenary approval for an on-site visit, and awaiting the final vote—is identical to the process followed by other countries that have been successfully delisted.
*   **Differences**: South Africa is a G20 economy with a complex financial system, and its deficiencies were linked to deep-rooted systemic corruption ("state capture"). This makes the challenge of demonstrating *sustained effectiveness* (particularly regarding prosecutions) arguably harder than for smaller nations with more technical compliance issues. This complexity could slightly increase the chance of the FATF wanting to see a longer track record. Conversely, the high economic and political cost of the grey-listing has generated immense and sustained political will in South Africa to implement reforms, which is a strong positive factor. On balance, these factors are roughly countervailing, suggesting the base rate for this specific reference class is still appropriate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The prior of 90% is already conditioned on the most important evidence: the June 2025 FATF decision to authorize the on-site visit. The key new piece of evidence is the subsequent reporting on the outcome of that visit.

*   **Evidence (E)**: Reports in late September 2025 indicating the on-site visit was successful and that South Africa's exit is anticipated in October.
*   **Likelihood if Hypothesis is True (P(E | H))**: If South Africa is on track to be delisted (H), it is extremely likely that the on-site visit was successful and that positive, albeit unofficial, reports would emerge. The probability is very high, P(E | H) ≈ 0.95.
*   **Likelihood if Hypothesis is False (P(E | ~H))**: If South Africa is *not* going to be delisted (~H), the most probable reason at this stage would be a failed on-site visit where assessors found significant implementation gaps. In such a scenario, it is highly unlikely that we would see positive media reports anticipating an October exit. Instead, we would expect silence or negative leaks. The probability of this positive reporting, given that the outcome will be failure, is very low, P(E | ~H) ≈ 0.05.
*   **Likelihood Ratio**: (P(E | H) / P(E | ~H)) ≈ 0.95 / 0.05 = 19. This is a very strong piece of evidence that increases the probability of delisting.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior Odds**: P(H) = 90% → Odds = 0.90 / (1 - 0.90) = 9 to 1.
*   **Likelihood Ratio**: 19.
*   **Posterior Odds**: Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 9 × 19 = 171 to 1.
*   **Posterior Probability**: Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds) = 171 / 172 ≈ 99.4%.

This mechanical update results in a very high probability. While directionally correct, it may overstate our certainty by not fully accounting for unquantified risks. I will use this as a strong signal to be in the high 90s, but will moderate slightly in the final step.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis hinges on the reliability of the reports about the on-site visit and the predictability of the FATF's final vote. What could go wrong?

1.  **The "Sustained Effectiveness" Bar**: The FATF's most subjective judgment is whether reforms are "sustained." Given South Africa's recent history, the plenary could decide that while the visit was positive, they want to see the new systems operate for another review cycle (i.e., until February 2026) before delisting. This seems to be the most plausible failure scenario.
2.  **Confidential Report Differs from Leaks**: The official report from the on-site visit is confidential. Public reporting is based on sources. There is a small chance the official report contains nuances or lingering concerns not reflected in the media, which could lead to a deferral.
3.  **Last-Minute Scandal**: A major, high-profile corruption or money laundering scandal breaking in South Africa in the weeks before the plenary could cause member states to question the country's political commitment and vote against delisting.

These risks, while individually small, collectively argue against extreme certainty (>98%). The "sustained effectiveness" argument is the most compelling reason for a small chance of failure. A combined probability of failure from these sources might be around 5-6%. This suggests a final probability in the mid-90s is more robust than one approaching 99%.

### 6. Final Forecast
South Africa has successfully navigated the vast majority of the FATF delisting process. It has completed its 22-point action plan, and crucially, has passed the FATF's own milestone of having an on-site verification visit authorized. This places it in a reference class of countries where delisting is the overwhelmingly common outcome. Recent reports that this final visit was successful remove the last major point of uncertainty. The remaining risks—a subjective judgment by the plenary on the "sustainability" of reforms or a last-minute scandal—are low-probability events. The evidence strongly points to a "Yes" resolution.

Final: 94%
