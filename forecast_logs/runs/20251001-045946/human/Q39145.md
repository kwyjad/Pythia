### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-war Dutch general elections (n≈25):** In the highly fragmented Dutch multi-party system, it is rare for one party to win the most seats in consecutive elections. Since 1946, the largest party has changed roughly 40-50% of the time from one election to the next. The winning party typically secures 20-25% of the seats (30-38 out of 150), a relatively low threshold for victory. This base rate suggests a high probability of change.
2.  **Elections following a collapsed coalition government (n≈10 since 1970s):** Parties perceived as responsible for collapsing a government are often, but not always, punished by voters. The outcome depends heavily on whether voters see the reason for the collapse as legitimate. If the party's core voters support the uncompromising stance, the party may consolidate its base but lose the broader appeal needed to remain the largest. The base rate is ambiguous, but it introduces significant volatility and risk for the party that triggered the collapse.
3.  **Elections featuring a populist surge (n≈4-5, e.g., LPF 2002, FvD 2019 provincials, PVV 2023):** Populist parties that experience a rapid surge often struggle to maintain that momentum into the next election, especially after a term in or supporting a government. The LPF collapsed after being in government; FvD's support fragmented. This suggests that a "sophomore slump" for the PVV is a plausible outcome after their 2023 breakthrough, particularly following a chaotic and short-lived government experience.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-05-26** PVV presents a hardline ten-point asylum plan. — **(↓)** — This action precipitated the crisis, framing the PVV as uncompromising and willing to sacrifice government stability for a single issue, likely alienating moderate voters.
*   **2025-06-03** Geert Wilders withdraws the PVV from the coalition, causing the government's collapse. — **(↓ Large)** — Directly responsible for the collapse. While it energizes his base, it likely damages his credibility with voters who prioritized the stability and governance he promised to deliver after the 2023 election.
*   **2025-08-22** NSC withdraws from the caretaker coalition talks. — **(↓ Moderate)** — Signals the complete breakdown of the 2023 right-wing coalition. The "complete collapse of NSC" mentioned in the background suggests its voters are now in play, likely scattering to more established parties (CDA, VVD, GL/PvdA) rather than the PVV, which was central to the dysfunction.
*   **2025-09-28** Caretaker PM Dick Schoof's interview highlights his role as a technocrat navigating a crisis. — **(↓ Small)** — Reinforces the narrative of instability caused by party politics. Contrasts the chaotic politicians (Wilders) with a steady (but powerless) administrator, subtly undermining the parties that caused the collapse.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **The Blame Game (Large):** The PVV unilaterally collapsed the government. Opponents will frame this as proof the PVV is incapable of governing and prioritizes ideology over national stability. If this narrative sticks, it will push moderate voters away. The PVV's counter-narrative—that they were defending Dutch interests against a weak establishment—will appeal to their base but is unlikely to attract new voters.
2.  **Voter Volatility & Fragmentation (Large):** The background states NSC has collapsed and CDA is renewed. NSC's 2023 voters were largely center-right (ex-CDA/VVD) seeking responsible governance. Their disillusionment with the PVV-led chaos makes them unlikely to move to the PVV. Their return to a "renewed" CDA or a "stable" VVD, or even to the opposition GL/PvdA, fragments the right-wing vote and lowers the seat count needed for any single party to win.
3.  **Opposition Consolidation (Moderate):** The GL/PvdA bloc, as the largest opposition force, is the natural beneficiary of government failure. They can campaign as the stable, credible alternative. The chaos on the right provides a powerful, simple message for them to rally centrist and left-leaning voters.
4.  **Issue Salience (Moderate):** The collapse was over migration, the PVV's signature issue. This keeps the topic front and center in the campaign, which normally benefits the PVV. However, their perceived failure to deliver on the issue while in a position of power may turn it into a liability, demonstrating their proposals are unworkable.
5.  **Incumbency Penalty (Moderate):** All four coalition parties (PVV, VVD, NSC, BBB) will likely suffer from being part of a failed government. The VVD, having enabled the PVV-led experiment, may be particularly damaged among centrist voters, potentially losing more seats to GL/PvdA or D66.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Triggering Party was the Largest:** Unlike many collapses caused by junior partners, this one was initiated by the largest party (PVV). This is a high-risk gamble that violates the norm of the senior partner ensuring stability.
*   **Independent Prime Minister:** The PM (Dick Schoof) is an independent technocrat, not the leader of the largest party. This means the "incumbency penalty" is not focused on a single leader but diffused across the four coalition parties, potentially harming them all.
*   **Rapid Rise and Fall of a Key Partner:** The "complete collapse" of NSC, a party that won 20 seats in 2023, is a massive electoral shock. This releases a huge number of voters back into the market, creating far more uncertainty and potential for large swings than in a typical election.
*   **Consolidated Left-Wing Opposition:** The GL/PvdA electoral alliance represents a more unified and powerful opposition bloc than the left has had in many previous elections, providing a clearer alternative pole for voters to gravitate towards.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior, based on the 2023 election results and the PVV's initial polling strength in government, would place the PVV as the favorite to win the most seats again (e.g., ~45% chance), with GL/PvdA as the main challenger (~35%). Equivalent n≈15, reflecting a reasonably stable situation post-formation.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   PVV intentionally collapsing the government: **↓ Large** (Breach of trust with non-core voters).
    *   NSC's electoral collapse and voter dispersal: **↓ Moderate** (Scatters the right-wing vote, making it harder for any one right-wing party to be the largest).
    *   "Renewal" of the CDA: **↓ Small** (Siphons center-right votes that might have otherwise stayed with VVD or drifted to PVV).
    *   GL/PvdA positioned as the stable alternative: **↑ Large** (for GL/PvdA's chances, which implies a relative decrease for PVV).
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points to a significant downward revision for the PVV. The posterior probability of PVV winning the most seats should be substantially lower than the prior, with GL/PvdA likely becoming the new favorite.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for PVV winning most seats):**
    *   Polling shows PVV retaining >90% of its 2023 voters, indicating the base is energized by the collapse.
    *   GL/PvdA leader Frans Timmermans makes a significant campaign gaffe or is successfully framed as an out-of-touch "Eurocrat."
    *   The VVD and a renewed CDA attack each other fiercely, splitting the center-right vote and preventing either from consolidating the anti-PVV right.
    *   A major external event (e.g., a terror attack, a new migration crisis) pushes security and immigration to the absolute forefront of the debate.
*   **DOWN indicators (for PVV winning most seats):**
    *   Consistent polling leads for GL/PvdA, especially if they cross the 30-seat threshold in multiple polls.
    *   Prominent VVD and CDA figures publicly rule out another coalition with a Wilders-led PVV, signaling to voters that a vote for PVV is a vote for instability.
    *   Debates show Wilders appearing isolated, with other leaders uniting to attack his record and perceived unreliability.
    *   Polling shows a significant share of former NSC voters moving directly to GL/PvdA or D66, not just to other right-wing parties.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Polling Unreliability:** Dutch polls failed to predict the scale of the PVV's late surge in 2023. A similar last-minute swing is possible, especially with high voter volatility.
*   **Fictional Scenario Dynamics:** This analysis is based on a hypothetical scenario. The specified "collapse of NSC" and "renewal of CDA" are major assumptions; the actual flow of these voters is the single biggest uncertainty.
*   **Campaign Dynamics:** The election is a month away. The performance of party leaders in televised debates can have a significant impact and cause rapid shifts in support.
*   **Turnout Effects:** The perception of government failure and chaos could depress turnout among moderate, centrist voters, which would disproportionately benefit parties with energized, high-turnout bases like the PVV.

**Final Research Summary:** The PVV's decision to collapse the government it led has likely proven a strategic error. By demonstrating an inability to govern and fracturing the right-wing electorate, they have created a clear path for the consolidated GL/PvdA bloc to emerge as the most probable winner of the most seats.

To forecast which party will win the most seats in the 2025 Dutch general election, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **PVV**: Given their recent victory in 2023 and the historical tendency for populist parties to struggle in maintaining momentum, a prior of around 20% seems reasonable, reflecting both their recent success and the risks associated with their role in the government's collapse.
- **GL/PvdA**: As a consolidated left-wing opposition bloc, they are well-positioned to capitalize on the government's failure. A prior of around 25% reflects their potential to attract centrist and left-leaning voters.
- **VVD**: Historically a strong party, but their association with the failed government could hurt them. A prior of 15% accounts for their established base but also the incumbency penalty.
- **D66**: A smaller party with limited chances of winning the most seats, a prior of 5% is appropriate.
- **BBB**: As a newer party, they have potential but are unlikely to win the most seats. A prior of 5% reflects this.
- **CDA**: With a renewal and potential to attract disillusioned NSC voters, a prior of 10% is reasonable.
- **JA21**: A smaller right-wing party with limited reach, a prior of 5% is appropriate.
- **Other**: Given the fragmented nature of Dutch politics, other parties collectively might have a chance. A prior of 15% reflects this.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **PVV**: Similar to past populist surges, but their role in the government's collapse is a significant negative factor.
- **GL/PvdA**: Different from the base case due to their consolidated position and the current government's failure.
- **VVD**: Similar to past incumbency penalties, but their role in the coalition adds complexity.
- **CDA**: Different due to their renewal and potential to attract NSC voters.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **PVV**: The collapse of the government and their hardline stance on asylum are likely to alienate moderate voters (P(E | H) low).
- **GL/PvdA**: Positioned as a stable alternative, likely to gain from the government's failure (P(E | H) high).
- **VVD**: Incumbency penalty and association with the failed government (P(E | H) low).
- **CDA**: Renewal and potential to attract NSC voters (P(E | H) moderate).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **PVV**: Prior odds = 0.25, Likelihood ratio < 1 due to negative evidence, Posterior probability decreases.
- **GL/PvdA**: Prior odds = 0.33, Likelihood ratio > 1 due to positive evidence, Posterior probability increases.
- **VVD**: Prior odds = 0.18, Likelihood ratio < 1, Posterior probability decreases.
- **CDA**: Prior odds = 0.11, Likelihood ratio > 1, Posterior probability increases slightly.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consider the possibility of a late surge for PVV or VVD due to unforeseen events.
- GL/PvdA's lead could be vulnerable if they fail to capitalize on the government's failures.
- Adjust probabilities to account for these considerations.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

GL/PvdA: 35%  
PVV: 15%  
VVD: 12%  
D66: 5%  
BBB: 5%  
CDA: 15%  
JA21: 5%  
Other: 8%  

These probabilities reflect the current political landscape and the evidence available, with GL/PvdA emerging as the most likely to win the most seats in the 2025 Dutch general election.

# Analysis of the 2025 Dutch General Election

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each party based on recent electoral history and current context:

**PVV (Party for Freedom):**
- Won 37 seats (24.7%) in 2023 election
- Prior probability: 25%
- Rationale: Incumbent largest party, but collapsed the government. Historically, parties that collapse governments often face electoral consequences.

**GL/PvdA (Green Left/Labor):**
- Won 25 seats (16.7%) in 2023 as a combined bloc
- Prior probability: 22%
- Rationale: Main opposition force, unified left bloc with established voter base.

**VVD (People's Party for Freedom and Democracy):**
- Won 24 seats (16%) in 2023
- Prior probability: 20%
- Rationale: Traditional center-right party with consistent support, but damaged by association with failed coalition.

**D66 (Democrats 66):**
- Won 9 seats (6%) in 2023
- Prior probability: 8%
- Rationale: Center-progressive party with modest but stable support.

**BBB (Farmer-Citizen Movement):**
- Won 7 seats (4.7%) in 2023
- Prior probability: 5%
- Rationale: Rural-focused party with limited national appeal, part of failed coalition.

**CDA (Christian Democratic Appeal):**
- Won 5 seats (3.3%) in 2023
- Prior probability: 10%
- Rationale: Traditional center-right party experiencing "renewal" per background.

**JA21:**
- Won 3 seats (2%) in 2023
- Prior probability: 3%
- Rationale: Small right-wing party with limited national appeal.

**Other:**
- Won 40 seats (26.7%) combined in 2023
- Prior probability: 7%
- Rationale: Includes NSC (which has "collapsed" per background) and numerous small parties.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to typical Dutch elections:**
- Multi-party system with high fragmentation
- Coalition government that collapsed before completing term
- Significant voter volatility between elections

**Key differences:**
- The largest party (PVV) initiated the government collapse, which is unusual
- An independent technocrat (Dick Schoof) served as PM rather than party leader
- The collapse of NSC (20 seats in 2023) creates unusual voter movement
- The "renewal" of CDA suggests potential consolidation on center-right
- The GL/PvdA alliance represents an unusually unified left opposition

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: PVV collapsed the government over migration policy**
- P(E|PVV wins): Low (0.3) - Voters typically punish parties that cause instability
- P(E|PVV doesn't win): High (0.8) - This action likely alienated moderate voters
- Likelihood ratio: 0.375 (negative for PVV)

**Evidence 2: NSC has completely collapsed**
- P(E|GL/PvdA wins): Moderate (0.6) - Some NSC voters may move left
- P(E|VVD wins): Moderate (0.6) - Many NSC voters were former VVD supporters
- P(E|CDA wins): Moderate (0.6) - NSC took many former CDA voters
- Likelihood ratios favor center parties over PVV

**Evidence 3: CDA experiencing "renewal"**
- P(E|CDA wins): Moderate (0.5) - Renewal could attract voters, but starting from low base
- P(E|CDA doesn't win): Moderate (0.5) - Even renewed, may not overcome large gap
- Likelihood ratio: 1.0 (neutral)

**Evidence 4: Government collapsed over migration (PVV's signature issue)**
- P(E|PVV wins): Moderate (0.5) - Keeps their core issue salient but shows failure to deliver
- P(E|PVV doesn't win): Moderate (0.5) - May energize base but alienate moderates
- Likelihood ratio: 1.0 (neutral)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

**Update for PVV:**
- Prior odds: 25/75 = 0.33
- Likelihood ratio from government collapse: 0.375
- Posterior odds: 0.33 × 0.375 = 0.124
- Posterior probability: 0.124/(1+0.124) ≈ 11%

This significant drop reflects that collapsing their own government severely damages PVV's chances of remaining the largest party.

**Update for GL/PvdA:**
- Prior odds: 22/78 = 0.28
- As main opposition to failed government: likelihood ratio ≈ 2.0
- NSC collapse benefiting them: likelihood ratio ≈ 1.2
- Combined likelihood ratio: 2.0 × 1.2 = 2.4
- Posterior odds: 0.28 × 2.4 = 0.672
- Posterior probability: 0.672/(1+0.672) ≈ 40%

**Update for VVD:**
- Prior odds: 20/80 = 0.25
- Government participation penalty: likelihood ratio ≈ 0.7
- NSC collapse benefiting them: likelihood ratio ≈ 1.3
- Combined likelihood ratio: 0.7 × 1.3 = 0.91
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 0.91 = 0.228
- Posterior probability: 0.228/(1+0.228) ≈ 19%

**Update for CDA:**
- Prior odds: 10/90 = 0.11
- "Renewal" effect: likelihood ratio ≈ 1.5
- NSC collapse benefiting them: likelihood ratio ≈ 1.4
- Combined likelihood ratio: 1.5 × 1.4 = 2.1
- Posterior odds: 0.11 × 2.1 = 0.231
- Posterior probability: 0.231/(1+0.231) ≈ 19%

Similar updates for other parties yield:
- D66: ~6%
- BBB: ~2%
- JA21: ~1%
- Other: ~2%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Dutch polls have historically underestimated PVV support
- The PVV's base might view the government collapse as principled, not chaotic
- GL/PvdA might face challenges mobilizing their voters
- The "renewal" of CDA might be overstated in impact

**Alternative scenarios:**
- PVV could experience another late surge as in 2023
- VVD could position itself as the responsible alternative to both PVV and left
- CDA's renewal could be more significant than expected
- A new issue could emerge that changes campaign dynamics

**Adjustments:**
- Increase PVV probability slightly to account for polling underestimation
- Decrease GL/PvdA slightly to account for potential mobilization challenges
- Increase CDA slightly to account for potential renewal momentum

## 6. Final Normalization

After adjustments and ensuring probabilities sum to 100%:

GL/PvdA: 37%
PVV: 15%
VVD: 19%
CDA: 18%
D66: 6%
BBB: 2%
JA21: 1%
Other: 2%

## 7. Final Forecast

GL/PvdA: 37%
PVV: 15%
VVD: 19%
CDA: 18%
D66: 6%
BBB: 2%
JA21: 1%
Other: 2%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on the provided scenario.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider three reference classes:

1.  **Incumbent Largest Party:** In the highly fragmented Dutch political system, the party that wins the most seats often changes. Since the 1990s, volatility has increased. The base rate of the largest party repeating its victory is likely less than 50%. This suggests the incumbent (PVV) starts from a non-dominant position.
2.  **Parties Triggering Government Collapse:** Historically, parties seen as responsible for collapsing a coalition government are often punished by voters who prioritize stability. However, if the reason for the collapse strongly resonates with the party's core base (as the PVV's stance on asylum does), it can consolidate that base. This reference class points towards a high-variance outcome: either a significant loss of moderate voters or a consolidation of the base, but rarely growth.
3.  **Populist "Sophomore Slump":** Parties that achieve a rapid, unexpected surge (like LPF in 2002, FvD in 2019, and PVV in 2023) often struggle to maintain that support in the next election, especially after participating in government. Voters' expectations are met with the messy reality of compromise and governance, leading to disillusionment. This base rate strongly suggests the PVV is likely to lose seats compared to its 2023 high water mark.

Synthesizing these, a reasonable prior would place the PVV as a contender but not a strong favorite. A starting point could be: **PVV: 35%, GL/PvdA: 30%, VVD: 20%, Others: 15%**. This reflects the PVV's 2023 victory but accounts for the historical headwinds.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current scenario differs from the base case in several crucial ways:

*   **The Largest Party Caused the Collapse:** It is unusual for the senior partner in a coalition to unilaterally withdraw. This places the blame for instability squarely on the PVV, making it a central campaign issue.
*   **Complete Collapse of a Coalition Partner (NSC):** The scenario specifies the "complete collapse of NSC," which won 20 seats in 2023. This is a massive electoral event, releasing a large bloc of center-right, stability-seeking voters into the electorate. Their destination is a key uncertainty, but they are unlikely to move to the party that caused the chaos they sought to avoid.
*   **Consolidated Opposition:** The GL/PvdA alliance represents a unified, credible alternative for voters tired of right-wing infighting. This provides a clear pole for anti-PVV sentiment to coalesce around.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of new information from the scenario:

*   **Evidence 1: PVV withdraws from the coalition, causing its collapse.**
    *   P(E | PVV wins most seats): Moderate. This action energizes their core base who see it as a principled stand. If the election becomes a referendum on migration, this could work.
    *   P(E | PVV does *not* win most seats): High. This action is very likely to be framed by all other parties as proof that the PVV is irresponsible and unfit to govern, alienating the moderate voters needed to remain the largest party.
    *   **Conclusion:** This evidence has a strong negative likelihood ratio for the PVV's chances.

*   **Evidence 2: NSC "completely collapses" and CDA is "renewed".**
    *   P(E | PVV wins most seats): Low. The collapse of NSC and resurgence of CDA fragments the center-right vote. These parties will now compete with PVV and VVD for the same pool of voters, making it much harder for any single one to achieve a plurality. NSC voters are particularly unlikely to reward the PVV.
    *   P(E | GL/PvdA wins most seats): High. This fragmentation on the right lowers the total number of seats needed to become the largest party. As the unified opposition, GL/PvdA is the most likely beneficiary of this dynamic.
    *   **Conclusion:** This evidence strongly favors GL/PvdA and disfavors the PVV.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update the prior odds for the PVV winning versus the field.

*   **Prior Odds (PVV vs. Field):** P(PVV) = 35%, P(Field) = 65%. Odds = 0.35 / 0.65 ≈ 0.54.
*   **Key Evidence:** The PVV causing the collapse and the subsequent fragmentation of the right (NSC collapse, CDA renewal). This combined evidence makes it much more likely that a party other than the PVV will win. The likelihood ratio P(E | PVV wins) / P(E | Field wins) is strongly against the PVV, perhaps around 0.4.
*   **Posterior Odds:** 0.54 (Prior Odds) × 0.4 (Likelihood Ratio) ≈ 0.216.
*   **Posterior Probability for PVV:** 0.216 / (1 + 0.216) ≈ 18%.

This is a significant downgrade. The majority of the remaining probability should shift to GL/PvdA, as they are the most direct beneficiary of the right-wing's disarray. The VVD and a renewed CDA will likely fight over the remnants of the center-right vote.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis points strongly to a GL/PvdA victory. What could go wrong with this forecast?

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The PVV's gamble succeeds. The election becomes a single-issue campaign on migration, a topic where the PVV has high ownership. Voters punish the "weak" coalition partners (VVD, NSC) for not backing the PVV's hardline stance. The PVV successfully frames itself as the only party willing to take decisive action, consolidating the entire right-wing populist vote and repeating its 2023 victory. The 2023 election proved that a massive, late swing to the PVV is possible.
*   **Rebuttal:** While possible, this scenario requires the PVV to overcome the powerful "unfit to govern" narrative. Having been given the keys to power and then crashing the car, it will be difficult to convince voters to hand them over again. The fragmentation of the right is a structural impediment that makes a plurality win harder.
*   **Adjustment:** The possibility of another PVV surge, while diminished, is not zero. The Dutch electorate is volatile. I will therefore keep the PVV's probability substantial, reflecting this uncertainty, but GL/PvdA remains the clear favorite based on the provided narrative. I will set the PVV's chances higher than my strict Bayesian update suggests, to account for this tail risk.

### 6. Final Normalization

Based on the reasoning above, I will distribute the probabilities as follows, ensuring they sum to 100%.

*   **GL/PvdA:** As the main, unified opposition, they are best positioned to capitalize on the government's failure and the fragmentation of the right. They are the clear favorite.
*   **PVV:** Severely damaged by being the agent of the collapse, but they retain a loyal base and the potential for a populist surge on their core issue. They are the second most likely winner.
*   **VVD:** As the traditional center-right party, they could attract former NSC voters seeking a "responsible" alternative to the PVV. However, they are also tainted by their participation in the failed government.
*   **CDA:** The "renewal" and "collapse of NSC" gives them a path to significant growth, but starting from just 5 seats makes winning the most seats a very difficult task. They are a dark horse.
*   **Others:** Parties like D66 and BBB are also implicated in the recent political turmoil or are unlikely to see the kind of growth needed to become the largest party.

PVV: 28%
Gl/PvdA: 50%
VVD: 15%
D66: 1%
BBB: 1%
CDA: 4%
JA21: 0%
Other: 1%
