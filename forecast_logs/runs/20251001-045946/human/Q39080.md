### Reference class & base rates
1.  **US Government Taking Equity Stakes in Major Corporations:** Historically, the US government taking direct equity stakes in large, publicly traded companies is extremely rare and almost exclusively occurs during severe national crises to prevent systemic collapse. The primary modern examples are the 2008-2009 bailouts of banks (TARP), AIG, and automakers (GM, Chrysler). Outside of these crisis-driven interventions, this is not a standard tool of US industrial policy. **Base rate: <5%** (derived from the handful of instances over many decades of government-industry interaction).
2.  **Major Unilateral Changes to Federal Grant Program Terms:** It is uncommon for an administration to unilaterally and retroactively alter the fundamental terms of a major, congressionally-authorized grant program after awards have already been announced or disbursed. Such actions invite legal challenges, create massive uncertainty for businesses, and risk political backlash. While program rules are often tweaked, changing a grant into an equity investment is a fundamental shift. **Base rate: <10%**.
3.  **Trump Administration "Deal" Renegotiations:** During his first term, President Trump frequently threatened to upend existing agreements (e.g., NAFTA, Iran Nuclear Deal) and often used high-pressure tactics to renegotiate terms. While many threats did not materialize, the *attempt* to renegotiate was a common feature of his policy approach. The reference class of "Trump administration attempts to renegotiate a major economic agreement" is relatively high, but the success rate for achieving a specific, novel outcome like equity-for-subsidies is lower. **Base rate of *attempt*: >50%; Base rate of *success* in this specific form: uncertain, but lower.**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-09-30] Lutnick slams H-1B visa system — (↑ small) — Reinforces the administration's aggressive, nationalist-economic posture and willingness to disrupt established corporate norms, making a hardline stance on CHIPS funding more plausible.
*   [2025-08-28] Intel deal announced (US govt gets 10% stake) — (↑ large) — The most significant event. It moves the policy from rhetoric to reality, creating a concrete precedent and a template for future deals. It proves capability and intent.
*   [2025-08-25] Trump vows similar deals with other semi companies — (↑ moderate) — Explicitly states the administration's intention to apply the Intel model to the companies in question, directly increasing the probability.
*   [2025-08-21] TSMC threatens to pay back subsidies — (↓ small) — Demonstrates that major foreign firms have leverage and are willing to push back, potentially making the administration more selective in its targets to avoid embarrassment or project failure.
*   [2025-08-21] Lutnick clarifies policy won't apply to TSMC/Micron — (↓ moderate) — Significantly narrows the set of potential targets. This removes two of the five named companies, reducing the number of paths to a "Yes" resolution.
*   [2025-04-01] Trump creates new body to oversee CHIPS Act — (↑ small) — Signals a clear intent to actively manage and change the program's direction, rather than letting it run on autopilot from the previous administration.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Ideology & Precedent:** Trump's transactional "dealmaker" worldview sees subsidies as a poor deal for the taxpayer. The Intel deal provides a powerful precedent and proof-of-concept that the administration will likely try to replicate for a political win. (Size: Large)
2.  **Bureaucratic & Legal Inertia:** Repurposing congressionally appropriated funds from grants to equity purchases is legally complex and administratively slow. Negotiating terms, performing due diligence, and executing a deal with a major corporation can take many months, a significant barrier given the <3 month horizon. (Size: Large)
3.  **Corporate Resistance & Leverage:** The remaining targets (Samsung, GlobalFoundries, Microchip) are not desperate for cash. They may refuse the terms, as TSMC threatened to. Their willingness to walk away from CHIPS funding is a major check on the government's power. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Narrowed Target List:** By publicly exempting TSMC and Micron, the administration has focused its attention on a smaller group. This could increase the pressure on the remaining companies (Samsung, etc.), but it also reduces the overall number of opportunities for a deal to be made before the deadline. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **National Security Imperative:** The core goal of the CHIPS Act is onshoring semiconductor manufacturing for national security. This gives the administration leverage, as it can frame accepting an equity stake as a patriotic duty and a requirement for partnership on critical infrastructure. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Non-Crisis Context:** Unlike the 2008 bailouts (the primary reference class), the target companies are healthy and the action is part of a proactive industrial strategy, not a reactive rescue. This changes the negotiating dynamics entirely.
*   **Executive Actor's Style:** President Trump's explicit preference for equity stakes and transactional dealmaking is a significant departure from past presidents who oversaw industrial policy or bailouts.
*   **Reinterpretation of Existing Law:** This is not a new program designed for equity investments, but the reinterpretation of a grant-based program (CHIPS Act) established by a prior administration, creating unique legal and political friction.
*   **Focus on Foreign-Headquartered Firms:** Key targets like Samsung and TSMC (though now exempt) are foreign, adding layers of geopolitical complexity not present in the bailouts of US-centric firms like GM or Citigroup.
*   **Extremely Short Timeline:** The question resolves in under three months. This is a very compressed timeframe for the government to negotiate and execute a novel and complex financial transaction with a major corporation.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (e.g., 10%) based on the historical rarity of the US government taking non-crisis equity stakes in major firms. Equivalent n of ~10, reflecting some uncertainty but a strong status-quo bias.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The Intel deal is a powerful piece of evidence, demonstrating both intent and capability and creating a direct precedent.
    *   (↓ Large) The extremely short (<3 month) timeline for a complex, novel government-corporate transaction is a massive barrier.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Lutnick's explicit exemption of TSMC and Micron halves the number of primary targets, significantly reducing the probability space.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The President's stated desire to replicate the Intel deal with the remaining firms is a clear signal of intent.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is strongly conflicting. The Intel deal dramatically increases the probability from the historical base rate. However, the combination of the very short timeline and the narrowed list of targets acts as a powerful brake. The posterior should move significantly up from the prior, but likely remain below 50%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public statements from Trump or Lutnick specifically naming Samsung, GlobalFoundries, or Microchip in the context of equity deals.
    *   Reports of high-level meetings between executives from these companies and the Commerce Department or the new US Investment Accelerator.
    *   Leaks from within the administration or the companies about ongoing negotiations over equity terms.
    *   Any company announcing a "strategic review" of its CHIPS Act funding.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A statement from Lutnick or another official that remaining CHIPS awards will proceed as grants without new stipulations.
    *   Samsung or GlobalFoundries publicly reaffirming their investment plans based on the original CHIPS Act terms.
    *   A complete lack of news or statements on the topic (the status quo is "no deal," and time is running out).
    *   The administration becoming consumed by a different, more pressing political or economic issue.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **The Intel Deal as a One-Off:** The administration may have targeted Intel for specific reasons (e.g., it being a US champion, a particular negotiating vulnerability) and may view that deal as a singular political victory with no serious intent to replicate it.
*   **Definition of "Acquire Stock":** The resolution could be triggered by acquiring warrants or other equity-like instruments, not just common stock. A deal for a token amount of warrants would be easier and faster to execute than a major equity purchase.
*   **Timeline Feasibility:** The primary uncertainty is whether such a deal is even possible within the timeframe. Government processes are notoriously slow, and a Q4 holiday slowdown could make the pre-2026 deadline impossible.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** All meaningful negotiations will happen behind closed doors. Public information will be scarce and potentially misleading (posturing, leaks).
*   **Subsidiary vs. Parent:** The resolution includes US-based subsidiaries. A deal with "Samsung Austin Semiconductor" would count, which might be an easier negotiation than a deal with the South Korean parent company, Samsung Electronics.

**Final Research Summary:** The administration has clearly demonstrated its intent and capability to take equity stakes through the landmark Intel deal. However, the path to repeating this success before 2026 is severely constrained by an extremely short timeline and a narrowed list of target companies who possess their own significant negotiating leverage.

To forecast the probability of the US government acquiring stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical base rate for the US government taking equity stakes in major corporations outside of crisis situations is very low, estimated at less than 5%. This is based on the rarity of such actions in US industrial policy history, with notable exceptions occurring during severe economic crises like the 2008 financial bailout.
   - Initial prior probability: 5%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarity: The current situation involves the US government potentially taking equity stakes in major corporations, akin to past crisis interventions.
   - Difference: Unlike past interventions, this is not driven by a crisis but by a strategic industrial policy shift under the Trump administration, which is a significant departure from historical norms.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Intel Deal (↑ Large):** The US government acquiring a 10% stake in Intel sets a precedent and demonstrates both intent and capability. This significantly increases the likelihood of similar actions with other companies.
   - **Short Timeline (↓ Large):** The timeline to execute such deals before 2026 is very short, which is a substantial barrier given the complexity of such transactions.
   - **Exemption of TSMC and Micron (↓ Moderate):** The exclusion of these companies reduces the pool of potential targets, decreasing the probability.
   - **Trump's Intent (↑ Moderate):** The administration's stated desire to replicate the Intel deal with other companies increases the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 5% / 95% = 0.0526
   - Likelihood ratio for Intel deal: High (e.g., 3:1)
   - Likelihood ratio for short timeline: Low (e.g., 1:3)
   - Likelihood ratio for exemption: Low (e.g., 1:2)
   - Likelihood ratio for Trump's intent: Moderate (e.g., 2:1)
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × (3/1) × (1/3) × (1/2) × (2/1) = 0.0526 × 1 = 0.0526
   - Posterior probability = 0.0526 / (1 + 0.0526) ≈ 5%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The Intel deal might be a one-off, and the timeline is a critical constraint.
   - Alternative scenario: The administration might focus on other policy areas, reducing the likelihood of further equity deals.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of a token equity deal or warrants, which might be easier to execute.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the evidence and constraints, the probability of the US government acquiring stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026 is estimated to be 20%.

Final: 20%

# Will the US government acquire stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the US government acquiring stock in any of the specified semiconductor companies (Micron, TSMC, Samsung or US subsidiaries, Global Foundries, or Microchip Technology) before 2026 - which is about 3 months from now.

The most appropriate reference class is "US government taking equity stakes in major corporations outside of severe financial crises." This is historically rare:
- During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the government took stakes in banks, AIG, and automakers
- Outside of crisis periods, direct equity investments by the US government in private companies are extremely uncommon

Given the specific context of the CHIPS Act being repurposed from subsidies to equity investments, I'll use a base rate of **10%**. This reflects the historical rarity of such actions while acknowledging the current administration's demonstrated willingness to pursue this approach with Intel.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The fundamental reluctance of the US government to own private companies remains
- Legal and administrative hurdles to converting congressionally-approved subsidies to equity stakes still exist
- Companies generally prefer subsidies without giving up ownership

**Key differences:**
- The Trump administration has already executed one such deal with Intel (10% stake for $5.7B)
- The administration has explicitly stated its intention to replicate this model with other semiconductor companies
- The CHIPS Act funding mechanism already exists, providing a vehicle for these transactions
- The national security imperative around semiconductor manufacturing gives the government leverage

These differences significantly increase the probability above the historical base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Intel deal completed (August 28, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the government will acquire stakes in other companies, the Intel precedent would almost certainly exist
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - If no other deals happen, the Intel deal would likely be a one-off exception
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5
- This strongly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Lutnick clarified TSMC and Micron are exempt (August 21, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even if other deals happen, exempting some companies is plausible
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - If no deals happen, we'd expect to see exemptions and backtracking
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.57
- This moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Very short timeline (less than 3 months remaining)**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - Complex equity deals typically take many months to negotiate and execute
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - If no deals happen, the short timeline would be a major factor
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.38
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Trump's explicit intention to pursue similar deals**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If deals happen, public statements of intent would almost certainly exist
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even if no deals happen, such statements might still be made
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.9
- This moderately increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 10% (odds of 1:9), I'll update based on the most significant evidence:

**Update on Intel deal:**
- Prior odds: 1:9 (10%)
- Likelihood ratio: 4.5
- Posterior odds: 4.5:9 = 1:2 (33.3%)

**Update on short timeline:**
- Prior odds: 1:2 (33.3%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.38
- Posterior odds: 0.38:2 = 1:5.26 (16%)

**Update on TSMC/Micron exemption:**
- Prior odds: 1:5.26 (16%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.57
- Posterior odds: 0.57:5.26 = 1:9.23 (9.8%)

**Update on Trump's stated intentions:**
- Prior odds: 1:9.23 (9.8%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.9
- Posterior odds: 1.9:9.23 = 1:4.86 (17.1%)

After these updates, my posterior probability is approximately 17%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the speed at which the Trump administration can move when motivated
- The Intel deal shows they can execute quickly when they want to
- Samsung might be particularly motivated to accept terms to maintain competitive position against Intel
- The question only requires ONE company to accept a deal, not all of them

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The administration might announce a "framework agreement" or MOU with a company before 2026, with the actual equity acquisition happening later
- A token equity stake (e.g., 1%) might be easier to negotiate quickly than a substantial one
- The administration might focus on a smaller company like Microchip Technology where negotiations could be simpler

**Adjustments:**
- Given the multiple potential targets and the demonstrated ability to execute with Intel, I should increase my probability somewhat
- However, the extremely short timeline remains the most significant constraint

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all factors, I believe there's approximately a 20% chance that the US government will acquire stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026. The Intel precedent and clear administration intent push the probability up significantly from the historical base rate, but the extremely short timeline (less than 3 months) and the narrowed list of potential targets (after TSMC and Micron exemptions) are powerful limiting factors.

Final: 20%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is the historical frequency of the US government taking direct equity stakes in large, non-distressed corporations as a tool of industrial policy. This is an exceedingly rare event. The primary modern examples (TARP, auto bailouts) occurred during a severe systemic crisis to prevent collapse, which is not the current situation. Outside of such crises, this practice is virtually non-existent in US history. Therefore, a low base rate is appropriate.

I will select a prior probability of **5%**. This reflects the strong historical and institutional precedent against the government acting as an equity investor in healthy private companies. In odds form, this is 1:19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the historical base case in several critical ways:
*   **Similarities:** The action involves the US government and major corporations, a domain where legal and bureaucratic processes are typically slow and deliberate.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Specific Actor:** The Trump administration has a documented preference for transactional, "deal-making" approaches and has shown a willingness to challenge established economic policy norms. This makes a departure from historical precedent more likely than with a typical administration.
    *   **Concrete Precedent:** The recent Intel deal, where the government took a 10% stake, is a powerful and immediate precedent. The base case has no such precedent. This single event dramatically changes the landscape of possibilities.
    *   **Non-Crisis Context:** Unlike the 2008 bailouts, the target companies are financially healthy. The government's leverage comes from offering subsidies (CHIPS Act funds), not from being a lender of last resort. This gives the companies more power to refuse the terms.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their impact on the probability.

*   **Evidence 1: The Intel deal is completed (US govt. gets 10% stake).**
    *   This evidence is far more likely if the government intends to pursue this policy with other companies (P(E|H) is high) than if it was a one-off event (P(E|~H) is low). It demonstrates both the intent and the capability to execute such a deal.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very high (>>1). This evidence **dramatically increases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Trump vows to target other companies with similar deals.**
    *   This is a public statement of intent that directly supports the hypothesis. While it could be mere posturing, it is much more likely to be said if the plan is real.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** High (>1). This evidence **increases** the probability, reinforcing the signal from the Intel deal.

*   **Evidence 3: Lutnick clarifies the policy won't apply to TSMC and Micron.**
    *   This narrows the field of potential targets from five to three (Samsung, GlobalFoundries, Microchip). This reduces the number of paths to a "Yes" resolution.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 4: The deadline is before 2026 (less than 3 months away).**
    *   This is a major constraint. Government processes and complex corporate negotiations are notoriously slow. Executing a novel deal of this nature in such a short timeframe, which includes the holiday season, is highly improbable. This condition is much more likely if no deal happens (the clock simply runs out) than if a deal is successfully completed.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very low (<<1). This is the strongest piece of evidence that **decreases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will walk through a conceptual update from the 5% prior.

1.  **Prior:** 5% (Odds: 1:19).
2.  **After Intel Deal & Trump's Vow:** The combination of a successful precedent and stated intent is powerful. This evidence is strong enough to overcome the low prior and make the event seem plausible, perhaps even likely, in the absence of other constraints. The odds would shift dramatically, for example, from 1:19 to something like 1:1 (a 50% probability).
3.  **After Exemptions & Timeline:** Now, we introduce the powerful constraints. Exempting TSMC and Micron reduces the opportunities. More importantly, the <3 month timeline is a massive barrier. If we believe this timeline makes a successful deal at least four times less likely, we would update the 1:1 odds.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds (1:1) × Likelihood Ratio (1/4) = 1:4.
    *   Posterior Probability = 1 / (1 + 4) = 1/5 = 20%.

This rough calculation shows how the initial strong positive evidence is heavily tempered by the practical constraints, resulting in a posterior probability that is significantly higher than the base rate but still well below 50%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of around 20% could be wrong.

*   **Why it might be too low (event is more likely):** A deal with one of the remaining companies (e.g., Samsung) might already be substantially negotiated behind the scenes. The public announcements could be the final steps of a process that has been ongoing for weeks. Furthermore, the deal could involve warrants or other equity-like instruments that are faster to execute than a direct stock purchase, making the timeline more feasible. The administration may be highly motivated to secure another "win" before the end of the year.

*   **Why it might be too high (event is less likely):** The Intel deal could have been a one-off, designed for maximum political impact with a US-based champion. The administration may have no real appetite for a protracted fight with other companies, especially foreign ones like Samsung. The bureaucratic and legal hurdles of the timeline might be truly insurmountable, regardless of political will.

*   **Adjustment:** The possibility of a deal being nearly complete is the most compelling argument for a higher probability. This "unknown unknown" suggests that simply writing off the possibility due to the timeline is risky. I will adjust my forecast slightly upward from the 20% calculated in the update step to account for this uncertainty. A probability in the low-to-mid 20s seems to best capture this balance of conflicting factors.

### Final Forecast
The administration has demonstrated clear intent and capability with the Intel deal. However, the path to replicating this success is severely constrained by the very short timeline (<3 months) and a smaller list of target companies. While the political will exists, the practical barriers of time and bureaucracy are immense. The final probability must balance the strong positive signal of the precedent against these powerful negative constraints.

Final: 23%
