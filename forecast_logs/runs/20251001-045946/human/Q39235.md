### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Vaccine DRC Outbreaks (2019-2024):** This is the most relevant reference class, reflecting modern response capabilities. There have been at least four such outbreaks in the DRC. They have been small and quickly contained.
    *   **Base Rate (Deaths):** Median of ~7, with a range of 5-12.
    *   **Reasoning:** Derived from outbreaks in DRC post-2019 where the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was a core part of the response (e.g., Équateur 2022: 5 deaths; North Kivu 2021: 6 deaths; Beni 2021: 9 deaths).
    *   **Limitations:** This reference class consists of only a few data points. The current outbreak has already surpassed the upper end of this range, suggesting it may belong to a different class of outcome.

2.  **All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-2024):** This class provides a broader historical perspective, including catastrophic failures. The DRC has experienced 15 prior outbreaks.
    *   **Base Rate (Deaths):** Highly skewed distribution. The median is around 30 deaths, but the mean is ~250 due to the 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak (2,280+ deaths). Excluding Kivu, the mean is closer to 60.
    *   **Reasoning:** Based on historical data from the WHO and CDC on all known Ebola outbreaks in the DRC.
    *   **Limitations:** This class mixes pre- and post-vaccine eras, as well as outbreaks in vastly different political and geographic contexts. Its primary utility is in establishing a plausible upper bound and understanding the potential for tail risks.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-04** Outbreak declared in Kasaï Province, DRC. — **↑** — The start of the event; establishes the baseline.
*   **2025-09-07** Report of 32 cases and 15 deaths. — **↑** — Early data shows significant size and a high case fatality rate (~47%).
*   **2025-09-22** Report of 57 confirmed/probable cases and 35 deaths. — **↑** — Sustained growth over two weeks, nearly doubling the death toll. The outbreak is not under immediate control.
*   **2025-09-24** Report of 58 cases and 37 deaths. — **↑** — Continued slow growth. The fact that growth is not exponential is a positive sign, but the outbreak is clearly not contained.
*   **2025-09-24** Outbreak reported as confined to the Bulape Health Zone. — **↓** — Geographic containment is a strong indicator that response efforts (contact tracing, ring vaccination) are establishing a perimeter.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Speed and Efficacy of Response:** The single most important driver. Rapid deployment of contact tracing, isolation units, and ring vaccination can halt an outbreak. Delays of even a few weeks can lead to exponential growth. **(Large impact)**
2.  **Vaccine Availability and Uptake:** The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is highly effective. The ability to quickly vaccinate contacts and contacts-of-contacts is the primary tool for containment. Low community acceptance or logistical hurdles would be a major negative driver. **(Large impact)**
3.  **Community Trust and Cooperation:** As seen in the Kivu outbreak, community resistance (e.g., hiding sick relatives, attacking health workers) can completely undermine response efforts. Trust is essential for effective contact tracing and vaccination. **(Large impact)**
4.  **Geographic Location and Population Density:** An outbreak in a remote, sparsely populated area is easier to contain than one in a dense urban center or a region with high mobility (e.g., near major transport routes or international borders). Kasaï is less connected internationally than Kivu. **(Moderate impact)**
5.  **Security and Political Stability:** Conflict severely hampers response by restricting access for health workers and fostering mistrust. The Kivu outbreak was defined by this challenge. The security situation in Kasaï, while historically volatile, is a key variable. **(Moderate to Large impact)**
6.  **Healthcare Infrastructure:** The pre-existing capacity of local clinics and hospitals to identify and safely isolate initial cases affects the starting point of the formal response. Weak infrastructure leads to delayed detection and nosocomial (hospital-based) amplification. **(Moderate impact)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Breached "Small Outbreak" Threshold:** Unlike the post-2020 DRC outbreaks which were contained with <15 deaths, this event has already reached 37 deaths. This indicates a significant initial failure or delay in detection and containment.
*   **Different Context than Kivu (2018-2020):** The Kivu outbreak occurred in a region with extreme population density, high mobility (bordering Uganda/Rwanda), and an active, multi-sided armed conflict. Kasaï Province has a different conflict history (the 2016-19 insurgency had a different character) and is more geographically isolated, which may aid containment.
*   **Experienced Response Teams:** The DRC and international partners now have extensive, hard-won experience from the Kivu and West African epidemics. The playbook for using vaccines, therapeutics, and community engagement is well-established, even if implementation remains challenging.
*   **Zaire Ebolavirus Strain:** The outbreak is caused by the Zaire strain, which is the most common and deadliest, but it is also the strain for which the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was designed and is proven to be highly effective.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior would be anchored on the "Post-Vaccine DRC Outbreaks" reference class. This suggests a distribution centered low (e.g., median ~15 deaths) but with a fat tail to account for failure risk. Equivalent n: ~4, reflecting the small number of relevant recent examples.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The death toll has already reached 37, decisively breaking from the post-vaccine reference class. This is strong evidence that the initial conditions or response were worse than in recent successes.
    *   **↓ (Small):** The growth in the last reported week appears linear rather than exponential, suggesting response efforts are having some effect and a Kivu-scale catastrophe is not the current trajectory.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The outbreak is so far geographically contained to a single health zone, a strong positive indicator for containment.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The location in Kasaï, rather than the more volatile and connected Kivu/Ituri provinces, reduces the risk of explosive, cross-border spread.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the posterior upwards from the initial prior. The median of the forecast should shift significantly higher, likely into the 75-150 range. The probability of a very low outcome (<50 deaths) has collapsed, while the probability of a catastrophic outcome (>1000 deaths) remains low but non-trivial.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Confirmed cases appearing in a new health zone, especially a major town like Kananga or Tshikapa.
    *   Reports of attacks on healthcare workers or treatment centers.
    *   WHO/MOH reports explicitly mentioning a high percentage of new cases not being on contact lists.
    *   Any confirmed case exported to a neighboring country.
    *   Reports of vaccine stock shortages or significant community refusal rates.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Two consecutive weeks of declining case incidence.
    *   Reports that >90% of new cases are from registered contact lists.
    *   No new health zones affected for a 21-day period (one incubation period).
    *   High reported ring vaccination coverage (>80%) in the affected area.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Lag & Reclassification:** Official numbers from the DRC Ministry of Health can be delayed and subject to revision. "Probable" cases may be reclassified later, changing the final count.
*   **Resolution Deadline:** The Jan 1, 2026 cutoff is critical. The outbreak could be officially declared over just after this date, or it could still be active. The final number is sensitive to this specific end date.
*   **Definition of "Attributed":** The resolution criteria rests on deaths "attributed" to the outbreak. This may include suspected cases who were not tested, introducing ambiguity compared to a "lab-confirmed deaths only" definition.
*   **Unknown Start Date:** The outbreak was declared on Sept 4, but the index case may have occurred weeks earlier. The extent of undetected community transmission at the start is a major uncertainty.

**Final Research Summary:**
This outbreak has already proven more severe than recent, small Ebola flare-ups that were quickly contained by vaccination. While the current geographic containment and linear growth are positive signs, the initial failure to prevent spread suggests the final death toll will likely be in the low-to-mid hundreds, far exceeding the post-2020 norm but remaining well below the catastrophic scale of the 2018 Kivu epidemic.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - For the base rate, I will use the "All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-2024)" reference class, as it provides a broader historical perspective and accounts for both small and large outbreaks. The median is around 30 deaths, but the mean is ~250 due to the 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak. Excluding Kivu, the mean is closer to 60. This captures the potential for both small and large outbreaks, which is important given the current situation.
   - Mean/Median: Median ~30 deaths, Mean ~60 deaths (excluding Kivu).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The outbreak is in the DRC, which has a history of Ebola outbreaks. The Zaire strain is involved, which is common in past outbreaks.
   - Differences: The outbreak has already surpassed the typical post-vaccine outbreak size, indicating a more severe situation. The outbreak is geographically contained, which is a positive sign for containment efforts.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The current death toll of 37 already surpasses the typical post-vaccine outbreak size, suggesting a more severe outbreak. This increases the likelihood of a higher death toll.
   - The outbreak is geographically contained, which decreases the likelihood of a very high death toll.
   - The linear growth in cases suggests some control over the outbreak, reducing the likelihood of a catastrophic outcome.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 30-60 deaths, the evidence of a higher current death toll shifts the distribution upwards. The containment and linear growth evidence suggest the outbreak may not reach catastrophic levels, but the initial breach of the post-vaccine norm suggests a higher median.
   - Posterior mean likely shifts to around 75-150 deaths, with a wider spread to account for uncertainty.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for exponential growth if containment fails.
   - Tail risks: Consider the possibility of the outbreak spreading to a new health zone or country, which could increase the death toll significantly.
   - Alternative forecast: A forecast assuming exponential growth could predict a much higher death toll, but current evidence does not strongly support this scenario.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the current evidence and uncertainties.

P10: 50  
P20: 70  
P40: 100  
P60: 130  
P80: 180

# Forecasting Ebola Deaths in DRC Outbreak Before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference classes to establish my prior:

**Primary Reference Class: Post-Vaccine DRC Outbreaks (2019-2024)**
- Most relevant for modern containment capabilities
- Median deaths: ~7 deaths per outbreak
- Range: 5-12 deaths
- However, the current outbreak has already exceeded this range with 37 deaths

**Secondary Reference Class: All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-2024)**
- Provides historical perspective including catastrophic scenarios
- Highly skewed distribution
- Median: ~30 deaths
- Mean: ~250 deaths (heavily influenced by the 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak with 2,280+ deaths)
- Mean excluding Kivu: ~60 deaths

Given that the current outbreak has already reached 37 deaths, I'll use a weighted combination of these reference classes, with more weight on the broader historical distribution since we've already exceeded the typical post-vaccine outbreak size.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Same virus (Zaire ebolavirus strain)
- Same country (DRC) with similar healthcare infrastructure challenges
- Vaccine availability (rVSV-ZEBOV) as in recent outbreaks
- DRC has experienced response teams with institutional knowledge

**Key differences:**
- Already 37 deaths reported (as of Sept 24, 2025), exceeding recent small outbreaks
- Geographic containment to Bulape Health Zone is positive compared to Kivu outbreak
- Kasaï Province is more geographically isolated than Kivu, potentially limiting spread
- The outbreak has shown linear rather than exponential growth in recent reports
- 15 months remain until the resolution date (Jan 1, 2026), allowing time for containment

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast higher:**
- 37 deaths already recorded, indicating initial containment failure (strong upward push)
- Growth from 15 to 37 deaths in ~2 weeks shows ongoing transmission (moderate upward push)
- Case fatality rate of ~64% (37/58) is higher than the typical 50% (slight upward push)

**Evidence pushing forecast lower:**
- Geographic containment to one health zone suggests effective perimeter (strong downward push)
- Linear rather than exponential growth in recent reports (moderate downward push)
- Availability of proven vaccine and established response protocols (moderate downward push)
- Kasaï's relative isolation compared to Kivu reduces cross-border spread risk (slight downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior centered around 60 deaths (weighted average of reference classes given the current situation), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update based on geographic containment:**
- Prior: Median ~60 deaths
- Evidence: Outbreak confined to Bulape Health Zone
- Likelihood ratio: This pattern is ~3× more likely in contained outbreaks than in widespread ones
- Posterior shift: Reduces median to ~45-50 deaths

**Update based on growth pattern:**
- Prior: Median ~45-50 deaths
- Evidence: Linear rather than exponential growth
- Likelihood ratio: This pattern is ~2× more likely in outbreaks that will be contained below 100 deaths
- Posterior shift: Further reduces median to ~40-45 deaths

However, I must account for the fact that we already have 37 confirmed deaths, which creates a hard lower bound. The distribution becomes right-skewed with a median around 75-85 deaths.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the risk of spread to new health zones or urban centers
- The apparent linear growth could be an artifact of reporting delays
- Community resistance to containment measures could emerge as seen in previous outbreaks
- Security situations in DRC can change rapidly, potentially hampering response efforts

**Tail risks:**
- High: If the outbreak reaches a major urban center or crosses borders, deaths could exceed 500
- Low: The outbreak could be contained within weeks with minimal additional deaths

**Alternative forecast:**
A more pessimistic forecaster might argue for a median of 150-200 deaths, citing:
- The initial containment failure suggests fundamental response weaknesses
- DRC's history of larger outbreaks (several with 100+ deaths)
- Potential for security deterioration in Kasaï

Rebuttal: The post-vaccine era has fundamentally changed Ebola response capabilities, and the geographic containment is a strong positive signal.

After considering these points, I'll widen my uncertainty bands but maintain a median in the 75-100 range.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is a composite of two reference classes:
1.  **Post-Vaccine DRC Outbreaks (2019-2024):** This is the most relevant reference class for "successful" modern responses. These outbreaks were small, with a median of ~7 deaths and a maximum of 12. This class informs the lower end of what's possible and suggests that most outbreaks in the modern era are contained quickly.
2.  **All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-2024):** This broader class is necessary to account for tail risks. It has a highly skewed distribution with a median around 30 deaths but a mean of ~250, driven by catastrophic failures like the 2018-2020 Kivu epidemic (>2,200 deaths).

My prior distribution is therefore heavily weighted towards a low number of deaths (median < 30) but with a very long, fat tail to account for the small but real possibility of a major containment failure.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The outbreak involves the Zaire ebolavirus strain in the DRC, where experienced national and international response teams and effective vaccines are available. This is consistent with the modern response context of the first reference class.
*   **Differences:** The most critical difference is that this outbreak, with 37 deaths already, has decisively breached the upper bound of the "small, successfully contained" post-vaccine reference class. This suggests a significant failure or delay in initial detection and response compared to those successful cases. However, the location in Kasaï Province is less volatile and internationally connected than North Kivu, which may make a catastrophic, Kivu-scale repeat less likely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
1.  **Evidence: 37 deaths as of Sept 24.**
    *   **Impact:** Strong upward push. This evidence is extremely unlikely under a prior expecting a <15 death toll. It forces a major update, shifting the entire probability distribution to the right. The possibility of a very small outbreak (<40 deaths) is now essentially zero. This makes a "problematic" outcome (e.g., 50-500 deaths) much more likely than a "successfully contained" one.
2.  **Evidence: Growth appears linear, not exponential (from 15 to 37 deaths in 17 days).**
    *   **Impact:** Moderate downward push, primarily on the tail risk. Exponential growth is the hallmark of an out-of-control epidemic. Linear growth suggests that the effective reproduction number (R) is near 1, meaning response efforts (contact tracing, vaccination) are having a significant impact and are roughly keeping pace with new infections. This makes a catastrophic, Kivu-scale outcome much less likely.
3.  **Evidence: Outbreak reported as confined to a single health zone.**
    *   **Impact:** Strong downward push. Geographic containment is the single most effective way to stop an outbreak. As long as the virus does not spread to new areas, especially urban centers, the number of potential infections is limited, and the outbreak will eventually burn out. This evidence significantly lowers the probability of a very large-scale event.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A distribution with a low median (~15) and a fat right tail.
*   **Update Step:** The initial evidence of 37 deaths is a powerful blow to this prior. `P(Final Toll | Prior)` was low for any toll > 30. `P(37 deaths | Final Toll is small)` is very low, while `P(37 deaths | Final Toll is medium/large)` is much higher. By Bayes' rule, this massively increases the posterior probability of a medium-to-large final toll. The median of my forecast shifts from ~15 to something well over 50.
*   **Second Update:** The subsequent evidence of linear growth and geographic containment tempers this upward shift. This evidence is more consistent with a final toll in the low-to-mid hundreds than in the thousands. It trims the extreme right tail of the distribution that was fattened by the first update.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The resulting posterior distribution is centered much higher than the prior. The lower bound is now fixed at 37. The central tendency is likely in the 100-150 range, reflecting an outbreak that is still active but being actively managed. The distribution remains right-skewed, acknowledging the risk of containment failure, but the extreme tail (>1000 deaths) now has a very low probability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Overconfidence Check:** My forecast is centered around a "problematic but contained" scenario. I could be underestimating the risk of a breakout. The "geographic containment" could be an artifact of limited surveillance, and a case may have already reached a larger town, seeding a new, more dangerous cluster. Community resistance, a key driver in the Kivu epidemic, could emerge and derail response efforts. This suggests I should ensure my P80 and P90 values are sufficiently high to account for this risk.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** A much lower forecast (e.g., median of 60) is plausible. This would assume the current linear growth represents the final stages of the outbreak and that containment is nearly complete. In this scenario, we are just seeing the last transmission chains play out.
*   **Rebuttal & Adjustment:** While a rapid end is possible, an increase of 22 deaths in 17 days indicates a still-active outbreak. A final toll of only ~60 would require an almost immediate halt to all new transmissions, which seems overly optimistic. Therefore, while I will keep my lower percentiles relatively low to account for this possibility, my median will remain higher. The risk of a breakout justifies a wide P10-P90 range and a P90 in the low hundreds.
