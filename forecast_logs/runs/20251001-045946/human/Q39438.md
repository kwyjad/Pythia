### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major Supreme Court Cases on Presidential Foreign Affairs/National Security Powers:** Historically, the Supreme Court grants significant deference to the President in these areas. In cases like *United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.* (1936) and more recently *Trump v. Hawaii* (2018), the Court has upheld broad executive actions based on statutory delegations of authority related to foreign policy and national security.
    *   **Base Rate:** The President's action is upheld in roughly 70-80% of these landmark cases.
    *   **Reasoning:** Derived from a qualitative review of major 20th and 21st-century cases where presidential authority in foreign affairs, delegated by Congress, was challenged.
    *   **Limitations:** This reference class may be outdated, as the current Court's jurisprudence on executive power has shifted significantly. Furthermore, this case involves tariffs (taxation), a power textually committed to Congress, making it distinct from issues like immigration or asset freezes.

2.  **Major Supreme Court Cases Involving the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD):** This more recent class includes cases where the Court has invalidated executive agency actions of vast economic and political significance that were not explicitly authorized by Congress. Key examples include *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) and *NFIB v. OSHA* (2022).
    *   **Base Rate:** The executive action is struck down in roughly 80-90% of these cases.
    *   **Reasoning:** Based on the outcomes of prominent MQD cases decided by the Roberts Court since its conservative majority solidified around 2020.
    *   **Limitations:** IEEPA is a national emergency statute, not a standard domestic regulatory one like the Clean Air Act. The Court may apply a different, more deferential standard when national security is invoked, even if the economic impact is large.

3.  **Supreme Court Rulings on the Scope of IEEPA:** Direct precedent is sparse. The key case, *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981), broadly upheld President Carter's use of IEEPA to nullify attachments on Iranian assets during the hostage crisis.
    *   **Base Rate:** Presidential authority upheld (100% of 1 major case).
    *   **Reasoning:** Based on the single most relevant Supreme Court precedent interpreting IEEPA's scope.
    *   **Limitations:** A single data point is not a reliable base rate. Furthermore, *Dames & Moore* involved a specific foreign policy crisis and asset freezes, not the imposition of broad-based taxes (tariffs) on global trade in response to more diffuse threats.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-05-28** Court of International Trade rules tariffs unlawful in *V.O.S. Selections*. — ↓ (Unlawful) — First merits ruling finds the tariffs exceed IEEPA authority because they don't "deal with" the threat.
*   **2025-05-29** D.C. District Court rules tariffs unlawful in *Learning Resources*. — ↓ (Unlawful) — A second court agrees on the outcome but with broader reasoning: IEEPA doesn't authorize tariffs at all.
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms the *V.O.S. Selections* ruling. — ↓ (Unlawful) — A respected appellate court, in a 7-4 en banc decision, upholds the invalidation of the tariffs, strengthening the legal case against them.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari and consolidates cases on an expedited schedule. — → (Neutral on outcome, but ↓ for "No 2025 ruling") — Signals the Court sees the issue as urgent and intends to resolve it quickly, making a non-decision in 2025 highly unlikely.
*   **2025-09-24** White House files brief defending the President's power. — → (Neutral) — Expected legal posturing; does not provide new information on the likely outcome.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine (MQD):** The current Court's conservative majority is highly skeptical of executive agencies claiming transformative power over the economy based on vague or old statutes. Imposing tariffs on nearly all imports is an action of immense economic and political significance. (Large driver toward **Tariffs unlawful**).
2.  **Foreign Affairs Deference:** A long-standing judicial tradition of deferring to the President's judgment in matters of national security and foreign policy. The government's case rests heavily on this principle. (Large driver toward **Tariffs lawful**).
3.  **Textualism & Separation of Powers:** The core legal question is whether IEEPA's text allowing the President to "regulate...importation" includes the power to impose tariffs, which are a form of tax. The Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises." A textualist/originalist interpretation is likely to view tariffs as a tax and thus a core legislative power not easily delegated. (Large driver toward **Tariffs unlawful**).
4.  **Availability of a "Middle Ground" Ruling:** The case involves two distinct tariff regimes: "trafficking tariffs" against three countries and "reciprocal tariffs" against the world. The former are tied to a more traditional national security threat (cartels), while the latter are based on an economic rationale (trade deficits). This provides the Court an avenue to split the difference. (Moderate driver toward **Mixed ruling**).
5.  **Nondelegation Doctrine:** A more aggressive cousin of the MQD, favored by Justices like Thomas and Gorsuch, which holds that Congress cannot delegate its core legislative powers at all. If this view prevails, the relevant section of IEEPA itself could be deemed unconstitutional. (Small-to-Moderate driver toward **Tariffs unlawful**).
6.  **Pragmatism/Institutional Concerns (Chief Justice Roberts):** A sweeping ruling completely invalidating the tariffs could cause massive economic disruption and a major political clash. The Chief Justice may favor a narrower ruling, perhaps a mixed one, to mitigate these consequences. (Moderate driver toward **Mixed ruling** or a narrow **Tariffs unlawful** ruling).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Conflict of Doctrines:** This case creates a direct collision between two strong reference classes: traditional foreign affairs deference and the modern Major Questions Doctrine. The outcome depends entirely on which framework the Court prioritizes.
*   **Unprecedented Use of IEEPA:** While IEEPA has been used frequently for sanctions and asset freezes, this is the first time it has been used to impose broad, economy-wide tariffs. This novelty means past deference may not apply.
*   **Tariffs as Taxes:** Unlike other foreign policy tools (e.g., travel bans, asset freezes), tariffs are functionally taxes. The Court is typically far more protective of Congress's explicit constitutional powers (like taxation) than of its general policymaking authority.
*   **Economic Scale:** The sheer scale of raising the average U.S. tariff rate from 2.5% to 27% is an economic transformation far exceeding the impact of previous executive actions challenged under the MQD.
*   **Nature of the "Emergency":** Using a "national emergency" statute to address a chronic issue like trade deficits is legally tenuous and may not persuade justices who look for a clear nexus between the emergency and the response.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior, balancing the conflicting reference classes, would be centered on **Tariffs unlawful** (45%) and **Mixed ruling** (30%), with a smaller probability on **Tariffs lawful** (20%) and minimal weight on **Other/No ruling** (5%). This reflects the current Court's leanings but respects the strong counter-arguments. (Equivalent n ≈ 10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Consistent lower court rulings against the tariffs: ↓ (Large) - Demonstrates the strength of the challengers' legal arguments across different courts and judicial philosophies.
    *   The rise and dominance of the Major Questions Doctrine on the current Court: ↓ (Large) - This is the most powerful doctrinal tool for striking down the tariffs.
    *   The distinction between the two tariff types (trafficking vs. reciprocal): ↑ for **Mixed ruling** (Moderate) - Offers the Court a clear path to a split decision, upholding the more targeted tariffs while striking down the broader ones.
    *   The expedited grant of certiorari: ↓ for **No 2025 ruling** / **Other ruling** (Large) - Shows the Court is committed to a merits decision before year-end.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the initial prior. The posterior should shift further away from **Tariffs lawful** and concentrate more heavily on **Tariffs unlawful** and **Mixed ruling**. The probability of **Tariffs unlawful** should increase, becoming the clear modal outcome.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for Tariffs lawful):**
    *   Oral argument questions from a majority of justices focusing on historical deference to the President in foreign affairs (*Curtiss-Wright*, *Dames & Moore*).
    *   Questions from swing justices (e.g., Roberts, Kavanaugh) expressing concern about judicial overreach into national security.
    *   Leaked information or court-watcher speculation suggesting the conservative majority is concerned about the foreign policy implications of striking down the tariffs.
    *   Amicus briefs from a surprising number of former national security officials supporting the government's position.
*   **DOWN indicators (for Tariffs lawful; i.e., UP for Unlawful/Mixed):**
    *   Oral argument questions from a majority of justices about the Major Questions Doctrine, separation of powers, and Congress's taxing power.
    *   Questions that distinguish between the "trafficking tariffs" and the "reciprocal tariffs," signaling an interest in a mixed outcome.
    *   Questions from conservative justices (e.g., Gorsuch, Barrett) about the specific text of IEEPA and whether "regulate" can be read to mean "tax."
    *   The Solicitor General struggling to define the limiting principle of the President's claimed authority during oral arguments.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** A ruling that vacates the lower court decisions and remands for further consideration without a clear holding on the legality of any specific tariff would resolve as **Other ruling**. This is a low-probability but possible outcome if the Court finds a procedural flaw.
*   **Ideological Complexity:** This is not a simple liberal-conservative issue. A textualist conservative (like Gorsuch) could join with liberal justices to strike down the tariffs on separation-of-powers grounds, while a pragmatic conservative (like Roberts) might seek a narrow or mixed outcome.
*   **Unpredictability of Oral Argument:** While often indicative, oral arguments can be misleading. Justices may play devil's advocate or explore arguments they do not ultimately adopt.
*   **Mixed Ruling Nuance:** The "Mixed ruling" option could manifest in several ways (e.g., upholding trafficking tariffs but not reciprocal ones, or upholding the D.C. court's reasoning but not the Federal Circuit's). The resolution criteria are broad enough to capture any such split.
*   **External Events:** A major new international crisis before the decision could theoretically (though improbably) influence the Court's thinking on the scope of presidential emergency powers.

---
**Final Research Summary:** The Supreme Court is likely to rule against the tariffs, driven by its modern jurisprudence limiting broad executive power (the Major Questions Doctrine) and a textualist reading of Congress's constitutional power to tax. A mixed ruling, striking down the broader "reciprocal tariffs" while potentially upholding the more targeted "trafficking tariffs," is the second most probable outcome.

To forecast how the Supreme Court will rule on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful:** Historically, the Supreme Court has shown deference to presidential authority in foreign affairs and national security, with a base rate of about 70-80% in such cases. However, this case involves tariffs, which are more closely related to Congress's power to tax, reducing the base rate to around 20%.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful:** The Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) has been increasingly used to strike down executive actions of significant economic impact, with a base rate of 80-90%. Given the economic significance of the tariffs, a base rate of 45% is appropriate.
  
- **Mixed ruling:** The possibility of a mixed ruling exists due to the distinct nature of the "trafficking tariffs" versus the "reciprocal tariffs." A base rate of 30% reflects this potential for a nuanced decision.
  
- **Other ruling:** Historically, the Supreme Court rarely issues rulings that do not address the merits in high-profile cases, suggesting a low base rate of 3%.
  
- **No 2025 ruling:** Given the expedited schedule, the likelihood of no ruling in 2025 is minimal, with a base rate of 2%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The case involves presidential authority in foreign affairs, similar to past cases where the Court has shown deference.
  
- **Differences:** The tariffs are a form of taxation, which is a power explicitly granted to Congress, making this case distinct from other national security cases. The MQD's recent prominence also distinguishes this case from historical precedents.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Lower court rulings:** Both the Court of International Trade and the D.C. District Court ruled the tariffs unlawful, suggesting strong legal arguments against the tariffs (Likelihood for unlawful: high).
  
- **Federal Circuit affirmation:** The Federal Circuit's affirmation strengthens the case against the tariffs (Likelihood for unlawful: high).
  
- **Expedited Supreme Court review:** Indicates the Court's intention to resolve the issue quickly, reducing the likelihood of no ruling in 2025 (Likelihood for no ruling: low).
  
- **Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's recent use of the MQD to limit executive power suggests a higher likelihood of ruling the tariffs unlawful (Likelihood for unlawful: high).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs lawful:** Prior odds = 0.20; evidence (lower court rulings, MQD) decreases likelihood significantly.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful:** Prior odds = 0.45; evidence (lower court rulings, MQD) increases likelihood significantly.
  
- **Mixed ruling:** Prior odds = 0.30; evidence (distinct tariff types) supports this possibility.
  
- **Other ruling:** Prior odds = 0.03; expedited review reduces likelihood.
  
- **No 2025 ruling:** Prior odds = 0.02; expedited review reduces likelihood.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence:** Consider the possibility of a ruling that upholds some tariffs based on national security grounds.
  
- **Alternative scenarios:** A narrow ruling focusing on procedural issues could lead to an "Other ruling" outcome.
  
- **Adjustments:** Increase the probability of a mixed ruling slightly to account for potential judicial compromise.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 15%  
Tariffs unlawful: 50%  
Mixed ruling: 30%  
Other ruling: 3%  
No 2025 ruling: 2%  

These probabilities reflect the current legal landscape, the Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence, and the specific context of the case.

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Tariffs lawful:**
- Base rate: 20%
- Reasoning: The Supreme Court has historically granted deference to presidential authority in foreign affairs and national security (e.g., *Curtiss-Wright*, *Dames & Moore*). However, this case involves tariffs (taxation), which is constitutionally a congressional power, making it distinct from typical national security cases.

**Tariffs unlawful:**
- Base rate: 45%
- Reasoning: The current Court has consistently applied the Major Questions Doctrine to limit executive power in cases of vast economic significance without clear congressional authorization (*West Virginia v. EPA*, *NFIB v. OSHA*). The Court's textualist/originalist majority is likely to view tariffs as taxes that require explicit congressional delegation.

**Mixed ruling:**
- Base rate: 30%
- Reasoning: The case involves two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking tariffs and reciprocal tariffs) with different justifications, providing a natural path for the Court to split its decision.

**Other ruling:**
- Base rate: 3%
- Reasoning: Procedural dismissals or non-merits rulings are rare in cases the Court has specifically expedited for resolution.

**No 2025 ruling:**
- Base rate: 2%
- Reasoning: The Court has granted certiorari on an expedited schedule with argument in November 2025, indicating a clear intent to rule before year-end.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other Major Questions Doctrine cases, this involves an executive action with enormous economic consequences based on a broadly-worded statute.
- Like other foreign affairs cases, it involves presidential claims of national security authority.
- The Court has maintained its 6-3 conservative majority that has consistently limited executive power in recent years.

**Key differences:**
- This case creates an unusual collision between two strong judicial doctrines: foreign affairs deference and the Major Questions Doctrine.
- The use of IEEPA for broad-based tariffs is unprecedented - it has typically been used for targeted sanctions and asset freezes.
- The "national emergency" justification for the reciprocal tariffs (trade deficits) is particularly tenuous compared to traditional security threats.
- The economic scale of raising average U.S. tariff rates from 2.5% to 27% exceeds the impact of previous executive actions challenged under MQD.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence: Lower courts consistently ruled against the tariffs**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.2 - Very unlikely to see unanimous lower court rulings against tariffs if they were clearly lawful
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.8 - Highly likely to see consistent rulings if the legal case against tariffs is strong
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25 (strongly favors "Tariffs unlawful")

**Evidence: Federal Circuit ruled 7-4 against tariffs with bipartisan composition**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.3 - Unlikely to see a strong majority ruling with bipartisan support if tariffs were lawful
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.7 - Expected outcome if the legal arguments against tariffs are persuasive across ideological lines
- Likelihood ratio: 0.43 (moderately favors "Tariffs unlawful")

**Evidence: Supreme Court granted expedited review**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = 0.1 - Very unlikely to expedite a case and then not rule in 2025
- P(E|Any 2025 ruling) = 0.9 - Highly likely to rule in 2025 given the expedited schedule
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11 (strongly disfavors "No 2025 ruling")

**Evidence: Two distinct tariff regimes with different justifications**
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.7 - Highly likely to see this structure if a mixed ruling is forthcoming
- P(E|Uniform ruling) = 0.4 - Less likely to see this clear distinction if the Court plans a uniform ruling
- Likelihood ratio: 1.75 (moderately favors "Mixed ruling" over uniform rulings)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**Update for "Tariffs unlawful" based on lower court rulings:**
- Prior odds: 45/55 = 0.82
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.2 = 4.0
- Posterior odds: 0.82 × 4.0 = 3.28
- Posterior probability: 3.28/(1+3.28) ≈ 77%

**Adjusting for Federal Circuit ruling:**
- Prior odds (from above): 77/23 = 3.35
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.3 = 2.33
- Posterior odds: 3.35 × 2.33 = 7.8
- Posterior probability: 7.8/(1+7.8) ≈ 89%

This seems too high given the complexity of the case and the competing doctrines. Let's adjust downward to account for the Court's deference in foreign affairs and the possibility of a mixed ruling.

**Adjusting for the two distinct tariff regimes:**
- This evidence increases the probability of a mixed ruling at the expense of both uniform outcomes.
- Shifting probability mass from "Tariffs unlawful" to "Mixed ruling" based on this evidence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the Major Questions Doctrine relative to foreign affairs deference.
- The Court might be more concerned about economic disruption from invalidating tariffs than I've accounted for.
- The conservative majority might be reluctant to constrain a Republican president's authority.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could uphold the tariffs on narrow grounds, finding that IEEPA's language about regulating imports is sufficient to authorize tariffs.
- The Court might issue a procedural ruling that avoids the merits question entirely.
- The Court could find the tariffs lawful but impose new constraints on future uses of IEEPA.

**Adjustments needed:**
- Increase probability of "Tariffs lawful" slightly to account for foreign affairs deference.
- Increase probability of "Mixed ruling" to reflect the natural division in the case.
- Decrease "Tariffs unlawful" from my initial update which was too confident.

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots:

**Tariffs lawful:** 15%
- Decreased from base rate due to consistent lower court rulings against tariffs and the Court's recent limitations on executive power.

**Tariffs unlawful:** 50%
- Increased from base rate due to strong lower court consensus, the Major Questions Doctrine's applicability, and the Court's textualist approach to separation of powers.

**Mixed ruling:** 32%
- Slightly increased from base rate due to the clear distinction between trafficking and reciprocal tariffs, providing a natural compromise.

**Other ruling:** 2%
- Decreased slightly as the expedited review suggests the Court intends a merits ruling.

**No 2025 ruling:** 1%
- Decreased due to the expedited schedule making a 2025 ruling highly likely.

## 7. Final Forecast

Tariffs lawful: 15%  
Tariffs unlawful: 50%  
Mixed ruling: 32%  
Other ruling: 2%  
No 2025 ruling: 1%  
(sum 100%)

Here is a probabilistic forecast based on the provided information, following the specified reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider two conflicting but relevant reference classes for Supreme Court cases:

*   **Reference Class 1: Presidential Foreign Affairs/National Security Powers.** Historically, the Supreme Court grants significant deference to the President in this domain (e.g., *United States v. Curtiss-Wright*, *Trump v. Hawaii*). This class suggests a high probability (perhaps 70-80%) that the President's actions will be upheld. This forms the basis for the "Tariffs lawful" option.
*   **Reference Class 2: Major Questions Doctrine (MQD).** The current Roberts Court is highly skeptical of executive agencies claiming vast, transformative power without explicit congressional authorization (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*). This class suggests a high probability (perhaps 80-90%) that the executive action will be struck down. This forms the basis for the "Tariffs unlawful" option.

These base rates are in direct conflict. The case also involves two distinct sets of tariffs, which makes a split decision plausible. Therefore, I will construct a blended prior that acknowledges both conflicting doctrines and the possibility of a compromise:
*   **Tariffs unlawful:** 40% (Slightly favored, reflecting the modern Court's preference for MQD).
*   **Tariffs lawful:** 30% (Reflecting the strong tradition of foreign affairs deference).
*   **Mixed ruling:** 25% (A significant probability due to the case's structure).
*   **Other ruling / No 2025 ruling:** 5% (Collectively, as these are less common outcomes for major, expedited cases).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This case has unique features that distinguish it from the pure base rate scenarios:

*   **Conflict of Doctrines:** The case forces a direct choice between the foreign affairs deference doctrine and the Major Questions Doctrine. The outcome will depend on which framework the Court prioritizes.
*   **Tariffs as Taxes:** Crucially, tariffs are a form of tax. The Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises" (Article I, Section 8). The Court is typically very protective of core powers textually committed to a specific branch. This fact weakens the "foreign affairs deference" argument and strengthens the "MQD/separation of powers" argument, pushing the case toward the "Tariffs unlawful" outcome.
*   **Structure of the Tariffs:** The challenge involves two distinct tariff regimes: "trafficking tariffs" (tied to a more traditional security threat) and "reciprocal tariffs" (tied to an economic rationale). This structure provides a clear off-ramp for the Court to issue a compromise decision, making the "Mixed ruling" option more likely than in a typical case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key evidence from the background information:

*   **Evidence:** Two separate federal courts (the Court of International Trade and the D.C. District Court) ruled the tariffs unlawful, and the Federal Circuit affirmed one of those rulings.
    *   **Assessment:** This is strong evidence favoring "Tariffs unlawful." P(multiple lower courts rule against gov't | Tariffs are ultimately unlawful) is high. P(multiple lower courts rule against gov't | Tariffs are ultimately lawful) is low. This evidence significantly increases the probability of "Tariffs unlawful" and decreases the probability of "Tariffs lawful."
*   **Evidence:** The Supreme Court granted review on an expedited schedule, with arguments in November 2025.
    *   **Assessment:** This strongly suggests the Court intends to issue a ruling quickly, making "No 2025 ruling" less likely than if the case were on a normal schedule. However, it does not guarantee a decision before the January 1, 2026 deadline. It has little bearing on the merits of the case (lawful vs. unlawful).
*   **Evidence:** The case involves two distinct tariff regimes.
    *   **Assessment:** As noted above, this structure makes a compromise possible. The likelihood ratio for this evidence favors "Mixed ruling" over the all-or-nothing outcomes of "Tariffs lawful" or "Tariffs unlawful."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I will conceptually update the prior probabilities based on the evidence.

*   **Initial Prior:** Unlawful (40%), Lawful (30%), Mixed (25%), Other/No Ruling (5%).
*   **Update for Lower Court Rulings:** The consistent rulings against the government in lower courts are strong evidence. I will shift a significant amount of probability mass away from "Tariffs lawful" and toward "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling." For example, P(Lawful) might drop from 30% to 15%, with that 15% being redistributed, making the new distribution approximately: Unlawful (50%), Mixed (30%), Lawful (15%), Other/No Ruling (5%).
*   **Update for Case Structure:** The two-tariff structure provides a clear path for a compromise, which is often favored by the Chief Justice. This pulls probability from the absolute outcomes ("Unlawful," "Lawful") toward the middle ground. I will shift some probability from "Unlawful" to "Mixed," resulting in a near-even split between the two most likely outcomes: Unlawful (~45%) and Mixed (~35%).
*   **Update for Timing:** The expedited schedule makes a 2025 ruling likely, but not certain. A decision for a case argued in November could slip past the December 31 deadline. I will assign a non-trivial probability (10%) to "No 2025 ruling" to account for this timing risk. The remaining 90% of the probability will be distributed among the other outcomes based on the proportions derived above.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Primary Blind Spot:** Am I underestimating the power of national security deference? In a time of perceived crisis, the Court might be unwilling to constrain the President's power, even if it stretches a statute's text. The arguments for deference are not frivolous, as shown by the dissent in the Federal Circuit. My final forecast keeps "Tariffs lawful" as a significant possibility (14%) to account for this.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Procedural Off-Ramp):** The Court could find a procedural reason (e.g., standing) to avoid a direct ruling on the merits, which would resolve as "Other ruling." While unlikely in a case of this magnitude taken on an expedited basis, it is a possibility. I have assigned a small probability (2%) to this outcome.
*   **Best Alternative Forecast:** A forecast centered on "Tariffs lawful" would argue that *Trump v. Hawaii* is the better precedent and that the Court's conservative majority will ultimately prioritize executive power in foreign affairs over textualist concerns about the taxing power. This is a plausible alternative view, but I believe the combination of MQD, separation of powers, and the explicit constitutional role of Congress in taxation makes it the less likely outcome.

### 6. Final Normalization

After updating for all evidence and considering alternative scenarios, I will normalize the probabilities to sum to 100%.

1.  **Timing:** There is a real chance the decision is not issued before January 1, 2026. I estimate this at 10%.
2.  **Merits:** For the remaining 90%, the probability is split among the merits outcomes. "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling" are the most likely, being nearly tied. "Tariffs lawful" is a distinct but less likely possibility. "Other ruling" is a small tail risk.
    *   P(Unlawful | Ruling happens) ≈ 42%
    *   P(Mixed | Ruling happens) ≈ 40%
    *   P(Lawful | Ruling happens) ≈ 16%
    *   P(Other | Ruling happens) ≈ 2%
3.  **Final Probabilities (multiplying by 0.9):**
    *   Tariffs unlawful: 42% * 0.9 ≈ 38%
    *   Mixed ruling: 40% * 0.9 ≈ 36%
    *   Tariffs lawful: 16% * 0.9 ≈ 14%
    *   Other ruling: 2% * 0.9 ≈ 2%
    *   No 2025 ruling: 10%

The final probabilities sum to 100%.
