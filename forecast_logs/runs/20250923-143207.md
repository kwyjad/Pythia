### Reference class & base rates
- **Cryptocurrency Annual Performance**: Historically, Bitcoin has closed higher than it started in about 60% of years since its inception. Limitations include high volatility and external influences.
- **Tech Stocks Annual Performance**: Tech stocks close higher about 70% of the time annually, but Bitcoin's volatility is much higher.
- **Commodity Annual Performance**: Commodities like gold close higher about 50% of the time, offering a more stable but less volatile comparison.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-01-23] ↑ — Trump’s pro-crypto executive order could boost Bitcoin by increasing institutional interest.
- [2025-09-22] ↓ — Regulatory uncertainty persists as Trump faces opposition on broader policy issues, potentially affecting market confidence.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Regulatory Environment**: Large impact; pro-crypto policies can significantly boost prices.
- **Market Sentiment**: Moderate impact; driven by news, social media, and influential investors.
- **Technological Developments**: Moderate impact; improvements in blockchain technology can enhance Bitcoin's utility.
- **Macroeconomic Factors**: Large impact; inflation and interest rates influence investment in cryptocurrencies.
- **Adoption Rates**: Moderate impact; increased adoption by businesses and consumers can drive demand.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Pro-Crypto Administration**: Unusual political support could lead to favorable regulations.
- **High Volatility**: Bitcoin's 125% rise in 2024 is atypical, suggesting potential for correction.
- **Global Economic Uncertainty**: Current geopolitical tensions may increase Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Bitcoin closes higher 60% of the time; equivalent n = 10 years.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Large: Pro-crypto executive order.
  - ↓ Moderate: Regulatory uncertainty and opposition.
  - ↑ Moderate: Continued technological advancements.
  - ↓ Small: Potential market correction after 2024 surge.
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move slightly up due to strong pro-crypto stance, but tempered by regulatory uncertainty.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - New pro-crypto regulations or policies.
  - Increased institutional investment in Bitcoin.
  - Positive technological advancements in blockchain.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Regulatory crackdowns or negative policy shifts.
  - Significant market corrections or crashes.
  - Major geopolitical or economic instability.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Volatility**: Bitcoin's price can change rapidly, making predictions uncertain.
- **Regulatory Risks**: Sudden policy changes can drastically affect the market.
- **Data Gaps**: Limited historical data for cryptocurrencies compared to traditional assets.
- **Market Manipulation**: Potential for price manipulation by large holders.
- **Technological Risks**: Security breaches or technological failures could impact confidence.

Final Research Summary: Bitcoin's potential to close 2025 higher is bolstered by a pro-crypto administration, but tempered by regulatory uncertainties and market volatility. Watch for policy developments and market sentiment shifts.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for Bitcoin closing higher than it started in a given year is approximately 60%, based on historical performance. This is chosen because it reflects Bitcoin's historical annual performance, despite its high volatility.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: Bitcoin's historical volatility and tendency to close higher in a majority of years.
       - Differences: The current pro-crypto stance of the U.S. administration is unusual and could positively influence Bitcoin's price. However, regulatory uncertainty and potential market corrections after a significant rise in 2024 could counteract this.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Pro-crypto executive order: Likely to increase Bitcoin's price (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)), increasing the probability.
       - Regulatory uncertainty: Could decrease confidence (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)), decreasing the probability.
       - Technological advancements: Generally positive for Bitcoin (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)), increasing the probability.
       - Potential market correction: Likely after a significant rise (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)), decreasing the probability.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds = 60% / 40% = 1.5
       - Likelihood ratio for pro-crypto stance = 1.2 (increases probability)
       - Likelihood ratio for regulatory uncertainty = 0.8 (decreases probability)
       - Combined likelihood ratio = 1.2 * 0.8 = 0.96
       - Posterior odds = 1.5 * 0.96 = 1.44
       - Posterior probability = 1.44 / (1 + 1.44) ≈ 59%
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: Bitcoin's volatility and potential for rapid changes in sentiment or regulation.
       - Alternative scenario: A significant regulatory crackdown or economic downturn could drastically reduce Bitcoin's price.
       - Adjustments: Consider the potential for unexpected negative events, slightly reducing confidence.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential risks, the final probability is adjusted to reflect a slightly more cautious outlook.
    
    Final: 58%
