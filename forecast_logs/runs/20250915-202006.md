  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the ending value of the UST 10Y Yield for the period Sep 29 - Oct 10, let's follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:
    
    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The historical range for the 10-Year Treasury Yield from 2019 to 2025 is 0.5% to 4.5%, with a recent 12-month average of approximately 3.5% to 4.0%. Given the current economic context, a base rate centered around 4.0% is appropriate. This reflects recent economic recovery and inflation concerns. The variance is moderate, reflecting typical fluctuations in response to economic cycles and policy changes.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The current yield is within the historical range, and economic factors such as inflation and Fed policy continue to influence it.
       - Differences: The Fed's dovish stance with signaled rate cuts is unusual amid ongoing inflation concerns. Bond market resistance and global economic uncertainty are also notable.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Fed rate cut signals (↓): Likely to decrease yields, moderate impact.
       - Bond market resistance (↑): Could keep yields elevated, small impact.
       - Economic slowdown concerns (↓): Likely to decrease yields, moderate impact.
       - Inflation persistence (↑): Could increase yields, small impact.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - Start with a prior centered at 4.0%.
       - Fed rate cut signals and economic slowdown concerns suggest a downward adjustment.
       - Bond market resistance and inflation persistence suggest a slight upward pressure.
       - Net effect: The posterior distribution shifts slightly downward, reflecting the stronger influence of rate cuts and slowdown concerns.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The forecast could underestimate the impact of bond market resistance or unexpected inflation spikes.
       - Tail risks: Consider scenarios where geopolitical tensions or unexpected Fed policy shifts occur.
       - Alternative forecast: A scenario where bond market resistance is stronger than anticipated could keep yields stable or slightly elevated.
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Considering the evidence and potential risks, the forecast is adjusted to reflect a slight downward trend with some uncertainty due to opposing pressures.

- **OpenRouter-Default** ok=True time=10623ms cost=$10.2725 parsed={'P10': 1.0, 'P50': 5.0, 'P90': 5.0}

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - For the base rate, I will use the historical biweekly stock return differences between Nvidia and Microsoft, which typically range from -5% to +5%. This range reflects the typical market fluctuations for these tech giants over the past five years.
       - The mean of this distribution is 0%, indicating no systematic advantage for either company over the long term, with a variance that reflects the ±5% range.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: Both Nvidia and Microsoft are major tech companies with significant market influence, and their stock performances are influenced by similar macroeconomic factors.
       - Differences: Nvidia's recent AI advancements and strategic partnerships are likely to enhance its stock performance relative to Microsoft, which is facing regulatory scrutiny. These differences suggest a potential shift in the distribution towards Nvidia outperforming Microsoft.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Nvidia's AI advancements and strategic partnerships increase the likelihood of higher returns for Nvidia, suggesting a moderate upward adjustment.
       - Microsoft's regulatory challenges decrease its expected returns, further supporting an upward adjustment for Nvidia relative to Microsoft.
       - Overall, these factors make higher outcomes for Nvidia more likely, suggesting an upward shift in the distribution.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - Starting with the prior distribution centered at 0% with a range of ±5%, the evidence suggests a shift towards Nvidia outperforming Microsoft.
       - The net effect of the evidence (Nvidia's AI advancements and Microsoft's regulatory issues) suggests a moderate upward shift in the mean of the distribution, perhaps by 1-2 percentage points, with a slight increase in variance due to increased uncertainty.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Consideration of tail risks: Economic downturns or unexpected negative news for Nvidia could lead to lower-than-expected returns.
       - Alternative scenario: If Microsoft's regulatory issues are resolved quickly, its stock could perform better than expected.
       - Adjustments: Given these considerations, I will slightly widen the distribution to account for these tail risks and uncertainties.
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Based on the updated distribution, I will provide the following percentiles:
    
    P10: -1  
    P20: 0  
    P40: 1  
    P60: 2

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To produce a probabilistic forecast for the excess returns of Nasdaq-100 Futures over S&P 500 Futures for the period of Sep 29 - Oct 10, 2025, we will follow the outlined steps:
    
    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The historical base rate for Nasdaq-100 outperforming S&P 500 in tech-driven periods is 1-2 percentage points (pp) per biweekly period. This is based on historical data showing Nasdaq-100's tendency to outperform during tech booms due to its heavy tech weighting.
       - Mean/median: 1.5 pp; Variance: 0.5 pp (reflecting typical variability in excess returns).
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The current situation involves strong tech earnings and AI advancements, aligning with historical tech-driven periods.
       - Differences: Current economic uncertainty and potential regulatory changes could dampen the typical outperformance, suggesting a need to adjust the base rate slightly downward.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Strong tech earnings and AI advancements are consistent with higher excess returns, suggesting a likelihood ratio favoring higher outcomes.
       - Economic uncertainty stabilizing the S&P 500 suggests a slight downward adjustment, but this is less impactful than the tech sector's positive news.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - Prior: Mean = 1.5 pp, Variance = 0.5 pp.
       - Evidence: Moderate positive impact from tech earnings and AI advancements, slight negative impact from economic stability.
       - Posterior: Adjust mean upward slightly to 1.7 pp, maintaining variance at 0.5 pp due to mixed signals.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: Tech sector volatility could lead to larger swings than anticipated.
       - Alternative scenario: If regulatory changes are more impactful than expected, the Nasdaq-100 could underperform.
       - Adjustments: Consider a wider spread to account for tail risks, increasing variance slightly.
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Given the adjustments and considerations, the final percentiles are:
    P10: 0.5
    P20: 1.0
    P40: 1.5
    P60: 2.0
    P80: 2.5
    P90: 3.0
