### Reference class & base rates
- **European Stock Indices**: Historically, major European indices like the DAX, CAC 40, and FTSE 100 have shown annual growth rates of 5-10% over the long term. However, these rates can vary significantly due to economic cycles and geopolitical events.
- **Spanish Economic Growth**: Spain's GDP growth has averaged around 2-3% annually in recent years, influencing the IBEX 35's performance.
- **Limitations**: Stock indices are influenced by numerous factors beyond economic growth, including investor sentiment and global market trends.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-09-01] ↑ — Spain's GDP growth forecast revised upward, boosting investor confidence.
- [2025-08-15] ↓ — ECB hints at potential interest rate hikes, which could dampen stock market enthusiasm.
- [2025-07-20] ↑ — Positive earnings reports from major IBEX 35 companies, indicating strong corporate health.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Economic Growth**: Moderate impact; stronger GDP growth can boost corporate earnings and stock prices.
- **Monetary Policy**: Large impact; interest rate changes by the ECB can significantly affect market liquidity and investor behavior.
- **Corporate Earnings**: Moderate impact; strong earnings reports can drive stock prices up.
- **Geopolitical Stability**: Moderate impact; stability in Europe and globally can enhance investor confidence.
- **Investor Sentiment**: Large impact; shifts in sentiment can lead to rapid market movements.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Recent Strong Performance**: The IBEX 35 has outperformed many peers recently, suggesting potential for continued momentum.
- **Economic Resilience**: Spain's economy has shown resilience despite broader European challenges, supporting stock market growth.
- **ECB Policy Uncertainty**: Potential rate hikes introduce uncertainty not fully captured in historical base rates.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a moderate probability of the IBEX 35 closing higher, based on historical growth rates (equivalent n = 20).
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Moderate: Upward GDP revision.
  - ↓ Moderate: ECB rate hike potential.
  - ↑ Small: Positive corporate earnings.
- **Net effect**: The posterior should move slightly up, reflecting recent positive economic indicators but tempered by monetary policy risks.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Continued GDP growth revisions.
  - Positive earnings surprises.
  - ECB maintaining current interest rates.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - ECB rate hikes.
  - Negative geopolitical developments.
  - Declining consumer confidence in Spain.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Economic Volatility**: Unexpected economic downturns could rapidly alter forecasts.
- **Policy Shifts**: Sudden changes in ECB policy could have outsized effects.
- **Data Gaps**: Incomplete data on corporate earnings or economic indicators could mislead forecasts.
- **Geopolitical Risks**: Unforeseen geopolitical events could disrupt markets.

Final Research Summary: The IBEX 35 is likely to close 2025 higher than it started, driven by strong economic indicators and corporate performance, though potential ECB rate hikes pose a risk.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast whether the IBEX 35 will close 2025 higher than it started, let's apply Bayesian reasoning:
    
    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The historical growth rate for major European indices like the IBEX 35 is typically around 5-10% annually. Given the recent strong performance of the IBEX 35, a reasonable base rate for the index closing higher than it started is around 60-70%. This reflects a moderate probability based on historical trends and recent performance.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The IBEX 35 has shown strong growth in recent years, aligning with historical trends of European indices.
       - Differences: The potential for ECB interest rate hikes introduces uncertainty, which is not always present in historical data. This could dampen growth prospects.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Upward GDP revision: This increases the likelihood of the IBEX 35 closing higher, as stronger economic growth typically supports stock market performance. Likelihood ratio > 1.
       - ECB rate hike potential: This decreases the likelihood, as higher interest rates can negatively impact stock markets. Likelihood ratio < 1.
       - Positive corporate earnings: This slightly increases the likelihood, as strong earnings support higher stock prices. Likelihood ratio > 1.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds: Let's assume a prior probability of 65% (odds of 0.65 / 0.35 ≈ 1.86).
       - Evidence impact: The upward GDP revision and positive earnings slightly outweigh the potential negative impact of ECB rate hikes.
       - Posterior odds: Adjusting for evidence, the odds might increase slightly to around 2.0.
       - Posterior probability: 2.0 / (1 + 2.0) ≈ 0.67 or 67%.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might be overly optimistic if ECB rate hikes are more aggressive than anticipated.
       - Alternative scenario: If geopolitical tensions rise or economic data weakens, the probability could decrease.
       - Adjustments: Given these considerations, a slight downward adjustment might be prudent to account for these risks.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential risks, a calibrated probability of the IBEX 35 closing 2025 higher than it started is 65%.
    
    Final: 65%
