## Per-model

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The historical frequency of U.S. government shutdowns can serve as a base rate. Since 1976, there have been 22 government shutdowns, with varying durations and causes. In recent years, shutdowns have become more frequent, with notable ones in 2013, 2018-2019, and 2023. Given this trend, a reasonable base rate might be around 20-30% for any given year, but considering the specific context of a looming deadline and political standoff, I will start with a prior probability of 40%.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The current situation mirrors past shutdown scenarios where political parties use the threat of a shutdown as leverage. The reversal of roles, with Democrats now using the shutdown threat, is a new twist but follows the same strategic pattern.
       - Differences: The political dynamics have shifted, with Democrats in the minority using the shutdown threat. This could either increase or decrease the likelihood of a shutdown depending on their negotiation strategy and the Republicans' response.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Evidence 1: The Politico article suggests a high likelihood of a shutdown due to the lack of an "obvious off-ramp." This increases the probability of a shutdown.
         - P(E | H) is high because if a shutdown is imminent, such articles are expected.
         - P(E | ~H) is lower because if a resolution were likely, there would be more optimism in the reporting.
         - Likelihood ratio > 1, increasing the probability.
       - Evidence 2: Trump's prediction of a shutdown suggests a pessimistic outlook from a key political figure.
         - P(E | H) is high because if a shutdown is likely, such predictions are expected.
         - P(E | ~H) is lower because if a resolution were likely, political leaders would likely express more confidence.
         - Likelihood ratio > 1, increasing the probability.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds = 0.4 / 0.6 = 0.67
       - Assuming a combined likelihood ratio of 2 (from both pieces of evidence), the posterior odds = 0.67 × 2 = 1.34
       - Posterior probability = 1.34 / (1 + 1.34) ≈ 0.57 or 57%
       - The evidence suggests an increased likelihood of a shutdown, but uncertainty remains due to potential last-minute negotiations.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might overestimate the likelihood if negotiations succeed unexpectedly.
       - Alternative scenario: A last-minute deal could avert the shutdown, as has happened in the past.
       - Rebuttal: The current political climate and statements from key figures suggest a higher risk than usual.
       - Adjustments: Consider a slight reduction to account for the possibility of a last-minute resolution.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for last-minute changes, the final probability is adjusted slightly downward to reflect these uncertainties.

    # Will the US government be shut down before October 2, 2025?
    
    ## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    
    To establish a base rate, I'll look at historical government shutdowns in the US:
    
    - Since 1976, there have been 21 government funding gaps, with 10 resulting in actual shutdowns where federal employees were furloughed.
    - In the last decade (2015-2025), there have been 3 shutdowns: January 2018 (3 days), January 2019 (35 days), and a near-miss in September 2023.
    - Shutdowns are more likely when government is divided (different parties controlling different branches).
    
    Given that we're looking at a specific timeframe (before October 2, 2025) and we know we're approaching the fiscal year deadline (October 1), this significantly increases the probability compared to a random day of the year.
    
    For fiscal year transitions specifically, the base rate is higher. Since 2010, approximately 3 out of 15 fiscal year transitions have resulted in shutdowns.
    
    **Prior probability: 20%** (3/15, or the approximate rate of fiscal year transitions resulting in shutdowns in recent history)
    
    ## 2. Comparison to Base Case
    
    **Similarities to base case:**
    - We're approaching the October 1 fiscal year deadline, which is the typical shutdown risk period
    - There appears to be divided government (Republicans control the Senate with 53 seats)
    - There's partisan disagreement over a funding bill
    
    **Differences from base case:**
    - The roles are reversed from typical patterns - Democrats are now using shutdown as leverage, not Republicans
    - President Trump is publicly acknowledging shutdown possibility, suggesting negotiations may be difficult
    - The specific policy demands aren't detailed in the provided information
    - We're very close to the deadline (September 27) with "no obvious off-ramp in sight"
    
    These differences, particularly the explicit statements about an impasse and the president's pessimism about reaching an agreement, suggest a higher probability than the base rate.
    
    ## 3. Evidence Evaluation
    
    **Evidence 1: "No obvious off-ramp in sight" (Politico)**
    - P(E|H): Very likely (~90%) we would see this language if a shutdown is imminent
    - P(E|~H): Somewhat likely (~40%) as brinkmanship rhetoric is common even when deals eventually happen
    - Likelihood ratio: ~2.25 (increases probability)
    
    **Evidence 2: Trump predicts shutdown "for a period of time"**
    - P(E|H): Very likely (~95%) the president would make such statements if shutdown is coming
    - P(E|~H): Less likely (~30%) the president would predict shutdown if deals were progressing
    - Likelihood ratio: ~3.17 (significantly increases probability)
    
    **Evidence 3: Need for 7 Democratic votes in Senate**
    - P(E|H): Very likely (~90%) this would be mentioned as a key obstacle if shutdown is imminent
    - P(E|~H): Moderately likely (~60%) this would be mentioned even if compromise is possible
    - Likelihood ratio: ~1.5 (moderately increases probability)
    
    **Evidence 4: Current date is September 27, just 4 days before deadline**
    - P(E|H): Very likely (~95%) we'd be this close without a deal if shutdown is coming
    - P(E|~H): Somewhat likely (~50%) as last-minute deals are common
    - Likelihood ratio: ~1.9 (increases probability)
    
    ## 4. Bayesian Updating
    
    Starting with prior odds of 20:80 (0.25)
    
    First update (Evidence 1):
    - Posterior odds = 0.25 × 2.25 = 0.5625
    - Posterior probability = 0.5625/(1+0.5625) ≈ 36%
    
    Second update (Evidence 2):
    - Posterior odds = 0.5625 × 3.17 = 1.783
    - Posterior probability = 1.783/(1+1.783) ≈ 64%
    
    Third update (Evidence 3):
    - Posterior odds = 1.783 × 1.5 = 2.6745
    - Posterior probability = 2.6745/(1+2.6745) ≈ 73%
    
    Fourth update (Evidence 4):
    - Posterior odds = 2.6745 × 1.9 = 5.082
    - Posterior probability = 5.082/(1+5.082) ≈ 84%
    
    ## 5. Red Team Thinking
    
    **Potential overconfidence factors:**
    - Last-minute deals are extremely common in shutdown scenarios
    - The articles may be emphasizing conflict for dramatic effect
    - We don't know the specific policy demands, which affects negotiability
    - Historical pattern shows many near-misses where shutdowns were averted at the last minute
    - The reversed party roles may change dynamics in unpredictable ways
    
    **Alternative scenarios:**
    - A very short-term continuing resolution (1-2 weeks) could be passed to allow more negotiation time
    - Trump might change position if economic advisors warn of market impacts
    - Moderate Democrats might break ranks to avoid being blamed for a shutdown
    
    **Best alternative forecast:**
    A reasonable alternative forecast would be around 50-60%, arguing that despite the rhetoric, Congress has strong incentives to avoid shutdowns and often finds last-minute compromises. The fact that we're only 4 days away but still discussing the possibility (rather than it being a fait accompli) suggests negotiations are still happening.
    
    Given these considerations, I should adjust my probability downward from 84% to account for the historical pattern of last-minute resolutions.
    
    ## 6. Final Forecast
    
    After considering the base rate, the specific evidence in this case, and accounting for potential overconfidence, I adjust my forecast to 75%.
    
    Final: 75%

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    
    *   **Identify Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the historical frequency of US federal government shutdowns that involve employee furloughs. According to the Congressional Research Service, between Fiscal Year 1977 and FY2024 (a span of 48 years), there have been 10 such shutdowns. This gives a raw historical frequency of 10/48, or approximately 21%.
    *   **Refine Base Rate for Context:** However, the political environment has changed, with shutdowns becoming a more common tool of political brinkmanship, particularly under divided government. The current scenario involves a Republican President (Trump), a Republican-controlled Senate that is not filibuster-proof (requiring 60 votes), and a Democratic minority in the Senate with the power to block legislation. This is effectively a form of divided government. A more specific reference class is the Trump presidency from 2017-2018, which had a similar R-President/R-House/R-Senate (not filibuster-proof) setup and resulted in two shutdowns. This suggests a much higher base rate.
    *   **Chosen Prior:** To balance the long-term data with the more recent, context-specific evidence, I will select a prior probability of **30%**. This is higher than the long-term average but avoids relying solely on a very small sample size (the first two years of the Trump administration). This translates to prior odds of 0.3 / 0.7, or approximately 3:7.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    
    *   **Similarities:** The current situation strongly resembles past shutdown crises. It is occurring at the end of the fiscal year (September 30 deadline), the classic flashpoint. The government is functionally divided due to the Senate filibuster. Rhetoric from both sides appears uncompromising, a common feature of pre-shutdown posturing.
    *   **Differences:** The primary difference noted in the Politico article is the "role reversal." Democrats, typically the party arguing for a "clean" funding bill, are now reportedly the ones using the shutdown threat to extract policy concessions. Republicans, who have often used this tactic, are now in the majority and calling for a clean bill. This novel dynamic makes the outcome less predictable than a standard showdown. It could lead to a miscalculation by either side, but it also might cause the Democrats, being in an unfamiliar role, to back down more easily to avoid being labeled as obstructionists.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    
    I will evaluate three key pieces of evidence from the provided context.
    
    *   **Evidence 1: Proximity to Deadline with "no obvious off-ramp"** (as of Sep 27, for an Oct 1 deadline).
        *   P(E1 | H): If a shutdown is going to happen, it is very likely that just days before, the situation would look bleak with no clear resolution. The path to a shutdown is often paved with failed last-ditch efforts. I estimate P(E1 | H) ≈ 0.9.
        *   P(E1 | ~H): If a shutdown is avoided, it is often through a last-minute deal. Therefore, it's still quite common for the situation to look dire a few days out. However, the phrase "no obvious off-ramp" is strong. Usually, the contours of a potential deal are visible to insiders. I estimate P(E1 | ~H) ≈ 0.4.
        *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR1):** 0.9 / 0.4 = 2.25. This evidence **strongly increases** the probability of a shutdown.
    
    *   **Evidence 2: President Trump predicts a shutdown "for a period of time."**
        *   P(E2 | H): If a shutdown is imminent, the President, as a central actor, would know this. Publicly predicting it serves to frame the narrative and assign blame to the opposition. This is a very likely action for this specific President. I estimate P(E2 | H) ≈ 0.85.
        *   P(E2 | ~H): If a shutdown is going to be avoided, the President might still predict one as a negotiating tactic to pressure Democrats into conceding. This is a credible bluff. However, it's a risky tactic, and a direct prediction is stronger than just warning of a possibility. I estimate P(E2 | ~H) ≈ 0.3.
        *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR2):** 0.85 / 0.3 ≈ 2.8. This evidence also **strongly increases** the probability of a shutdown.
    
    *   **Evidence 3: The "Role Reversal" Dynamic.**
        *   P(E3 | H): A shutdown occurs because of intractable conflict. This unusual dynamic, where both parties are acting contrary to their usual roles, could easily lead to miscalculations and a failure to compromise, resulting in a shutdown. I estimate P(E3 | H) ≈ 0.7.
        *   P(E3 | ~H): If a shutdown is avoided, it's because one side concedes. The unusual nature of this dynamic might make a concession *more* likely. Democrats may be uncomfortable being the aggressors, or Republicans may be more eager to appear as the responsible governing party. This dynamic could still exist in a world where a last-minute deal is reached. I estimate P(E3 | ~H) ≈ 0.5.
        *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR3):** 0.7 / 0.5 = 1.4. This evidence **moderately increases** the probability, primarily because it signals a genuine conflict, even if the outcome is uncertain.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    
    *   **Prior Odds:** 3:7 (30% probability)
    *   **Combined Likelihood Ratio:** LR_total = LR1 × LR2 × LR3 ≈ 2.25 × 2.8 × 1.4 ≈ 8.82
    *   **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × LR_total = (3/7) × 8.82 ≈ 0.428 × 8.82 ≈ 3.78
    *   **Posterior Probability:** Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds) = 3.78 / (1 + 3.78) ≈ 0.79, or **79%**.
    
    The calculation suggests a very high probability of a shutdown.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    
    *   **Critique:** The biggest risk is over-weighting the political rhetoric. Brinkmanship is theater, and the vast majority of the time, a last-minute deal is reached because the consequences of a shutdown are negative for both parties, especially the party seen as the majority. The "role reversal" could be the very thing that breaks the stalemate, as Democrats may not have the stomach to be seen as the party shutting down the government, a charge they have effectively leveled against Republicans for years. My likelihood ratios might be too aggressive.
    *   **Alternative Scenario:** The Republican majority, wanting to project an image of competence, offers a clean, short-term Continuing Resolution (CR). Seven or more Democrats, facing immense pressure not to be the cause of a shutdown, cross the aisle to vote for it, averting a crisis and pushing the fight to a later date. This is the standard "kick the can" resolution.
    *   **Adjustment:** The calculated 79% feels high, though the evidence is compelling. The "last-minute deal" scenario remains plausible. The proximity to the deadline and Trump's direct prediction are the strongest factors. A slight downward adjustment to account for the possibility that this is all high-stakes negotiation seems prudent. The core of the evidence points strongly toward a shutdown, but the ever-present possibility of a last-minute escape warrants caution. I will adjust my final forecast slightly lower than the strict calculation to reflect this uncertainty. A value in the low 70s seems more robust.
    
    ### 6. Final Forecast
    
    The base rate of a shutdown is significant but not dominant (~30%). However, the specific evidence provided is highly indicative of a shutdown. We are days from the deadline with "no obvious off-ramp," the President is publicly predicting a shutdown, and the parties are locked in a conflict. While a last-minute deal is always a possibility in Washington, these signals are stronger than the typical pre-deadline posturing. The probability is high that at least a short shutdown will occur before October 2, 2025.

    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    An appropriate base rate for a US federal government shutdown is the historical frequency of such events around fiscal year deadlines (October 1). Since 1990, there have been four major shutdown periods (1995, 1996, 2013, and 2018-2019), but only one started exactly on October 1 (2013). Over 34 years, this suggests a ~3-5% annual base rate for an October 1 shutdown. However, when adjusting for periods with reported partisan standoffs and public threats (e.g., 2011, 2013, 2018, 2021, 2023), about 1 in 4-5 such threats result in a shutdown (e.g., 2013 and 2018 did, while 2011, 2021, and 2023 did not). Given the background's description of a serious impasse, I select a base rate of 20% as the prior probability P(H). This uses the reference class of "fiscal deadlines with media-reported standoffs." Prior odds: 1:4 (P(H) = 0.2).
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    The base case is a typical fiscal deadline standoff, like 2013 (Republican-led House forcing issues) or 2018 (Trump-era border wall demands). Similarities: Partisan leverage over funding, need for bipartisan votes in Senate (60 needed), and no clear resolution path days before the deadline. Differences: Roles are reversed—Democrats (minority) are pushing priorities instead of Republicans, which is unusual as Democrats historically prefer "clean" bills to avoid blame. This might make shutdown slightly less likely, as Democrats could back down to avoid political fallout. However, Trump's prediction of a shutdown suggests executive willingness to let it happen, similar to 2018, which increases relevance to cases where it did occur.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **Piece 1: No obvious off-ramp as of Sept 22, with impasse in Senate.** P(E|H) ≈ 85% (shutdowns often have late impasses). P(E|~H) ≈ 50% (averted shutdowns frequently look dire until last-minute deals). LR = 85/50 = 1.7. This increases the probability.
    - **Piece 2: Trump predicts shutdown "for a period of time."** P(E|H) ≈ 70% (presidents may signal acceptance if shutdown is imminent, as in 2018). P(E|~H) ≈ 25% (less likely to predict if expecting a deal). LR = 70/25 = 2.8. This increases the probability.
    - **Piece 3: Roles reversed, Democrats using leverage.** P(E|H) ≈ 60% (unusual dynamic could harden positions). P(E|~H) ≈ 50% (might lead to compromise if atypical). LR = 60/50 = 1.2. This slightly increases the probability.
    - Overall qualitative: Evidence leans positive for shutdown, with combined LR ≈ 1.7 × 2.8 × 1.2 ≈ 5.7 (moderate update).
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    Using Bayes' Rule conceptually: Posterior odds = Prior odds × LR. Prior odds = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25 (1:4).  
    Explicit update step (using overall LR of 5.7): Posterior odds = 0.25 × 5.7 ≈ 1.425 (roughly 1.4:1).  
    Posterior probability = 1.425 / (1 + 1.425) ≈ 0.59 (59%).  
    The evidence updates the prior upward due to Trump's prediction and ongoing impasse, but uncertainty remains high as last-minute deals are common (e.g., 2023). The posterior reflects moderate confidence, with room for resolution before October 1.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    Potential overconfidence: My LR may overweigh Trump's prediction—presidential statements can be negotiating tactics, not reliable signals (e.g., threats in 2011 didn't lead to shutdown). Blind spots: Ignores possibility of cross-party defections (e.g., a few Democrats voting for a clean CR) or procedural workarounds. Tail risks: A very brief shutdown (e.g., 1 day) still resolves Yes, but extreme scenarios like national emergency forcing a deal are low-probability (~5%). Best alternative forecast: 25% (emphasizing that 70-80% of threats avert, per recent history like 2021/2023), plausible if Democrats fold to avoid blame. Rebuttal: Trump's explicit prediction and reversed roles make this more like 2013/2018 (which did happen) than averted cases. Adjusting slightly downward for over-update risk, to ~50% posterior.
