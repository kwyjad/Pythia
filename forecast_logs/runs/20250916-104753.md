### Reference class & base rates
- **US Antimicrobial Sales Trends**: Historically, sales have decreased by 2% from 2022 to 2023 and by 37% since 2015. Base rate suggests a declining trend.
- **Global Antibiotic Use in Livestock**: Many countries report decreasing use, aligning with global efforts to reduce antibiotic resistance. Base rate is a decline or stabilization.
- **FDA Reports**: Regular annual reports provide consistent data, but may lag in capturing rapid policy or market changes.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2023-12-15] ↓ — FDA report shows a 2% decrease in antimicrobial sales from 2022 to 2023.
- [2023-06-01] ↓ — New regulations on antibiotic use in livestock announced, aiming to further reduce usage.
- [2024-03-10] ↑ — Reports of increased livestock production could drive higher antibiotic demand.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Regulatory Changes**: Large impact; stricter regulations typically reduce sales.
- **Livestock Production Levels**: Moderate impact; higher production may increase demand for antibiotics.
- **Public Health Campaigns**: Moderate impact; increased awareness can lead to reduced usage.
- **Market Demand for Meat**: Small impact; shifts in consumer preferences can indirectly affect antibiotic sales.
- **Technological Advances**: Small impact; innovations in animal health can reduce reliance on antibiotics.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Regulatory Environment**: Recent stricter regulations could accelerate the decline beyond historical trends.
- **Public Awareness**: Increased focus on antibiotic resistance may further suppress demand.
- **Economic Conditions**: Inflation or economic downturns could affect livestock production and antibiotic sales.
- **Technological Adoption**: Faster adoption of alternatives to antibiotics could alter trends.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Declining trend in antimicrobial sales; equivalent n = moderate strength.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↓ Regulatory changes (moderate)
  - ↓ Public health campaigns (moderate)
  - ↑ Increased livestock production (small)
  - ↓ Recent sales data (large)
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move down slightly, reinforcing the declining trend.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Increase in livestock production reports.
  - Relaxation of regulatory measures.
  - Rise in meat consumption trends.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - New regulatory announcements.
  - Public campaigns against antibiotic use.
  - Reports of technological alternatives adoption.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Data Gaps**: Lag in data reporting can obscure recent trends.
- **Regime Changes**: Sudden policy shifts could alter the landscape.
- **Definitional Changes**: Changes in what constitutes "medically important" antimicrobials could affect data.
- **Market Volatility**: Economic shifts could unpredictably impact livestock production and antibiotic sales.

Final Research Summary: The declining trend in antimicrobial sales for livestock is likely to continue into 2024, driven by regulatory pressures and public health campaigns, despite potential increases in livestock production.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for this event is derived from the historical trend of antimicrobial sales in the US. The data shows a 2% decrease from 2022 to 2023 and a 37% decrease since 2015. This suggests a declining trend in sales. Therefore, the base rate for an increase in sales is low. I will start with a prior probability of 20% for an increase in sales, reflecting the historical trend of decline.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The current situation continues to reflect the historical trend of decreasing antimicrobial sales due to regulatory pressures and public health campaigns.
       - Differences: There is a report of increased livestock production, which could drive demand for antibiotics. However, this is countered by new regulations aiming to reduce usage.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - **Regulatory Changes**: New regulations are likely to decrease sales (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)). This evidence decreases the probability of an increase.
       - **Public Health Campaigns**: These campaigns are likely to decrease sales (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)). This evidence decreases the probability of an increase.
       - **Increased Livestock Production**: This could increase sales (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)), but the impact is small compared to regulatory changes. This evidence slightly increases the probability of an increase.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25
       - Likelihood ratio for regulatory changes and public health campaigns combined is less than 1, indicating a decrease in probability.
       - Likelihood ratio for increased livestock production is slightly more than 1, but its impact is small.
       - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Combined likelihood ratio (less than 1)
       - Posterior probability = Posterior odds / (1 + Posterior odds)
       - Given the strong evidence from regulatory changes and public health campaigns, the posterior probability remains low, around 15%.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence could arise from underestimating the impact of increased livestock production or potential economic changes that might drive sales up.
       - An alternative scenario could involve a significant increase in livestock production or a relaxation of regulations, leading to increased sales.
       - However, given the strong regulatory environment and public health focus, these scenarios seem less likely.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the probability of antimicrobial drug sales for livestock increasing by at least 0.5% in 2024 is low.
       
    Final: 15%
