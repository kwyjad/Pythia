### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical Deportation Rates**: Average annual deportations under Trump (375,000) and Obama (375,000) administrations. Limitations: Political and policy changes can significantly alter these rates.
- **Recent Trends**: FY 2024 saw 271,484 deportations, a 43% increase from FY 2023. Limitations: Recent increases may not sustain without policy shifts.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2024-11-19] ↑ — Trump's campaign promises mass deportations, potentially increasing deportation efforts.
- [2025-06-17] ↓ — Criticism of Trump's immigration policies may hinder aggressive deportation plans.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Political Will**: Large — Presidential directives can significantly increase deportation efforts.
- **Resource Allocation**: Moderate — Increased funding and staffing for ICE can boost deportations.
- **Legal Challenges**: Moderate — Court rulings can impede or facilitate deportation processes.
- **Public Opinion**: Small — Public support or opposition can influence policy implementation.
- **International Relations**: Small — Cooperation with other countries affects deportation logistics.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Election Year Promises**: Trump's explicit focus on mass deportations is more aggressive than past rhetoric.
- **Resource Constraints**: Current ICE resources may not support a doubling of deportations without significant increases.
- **Legal Environment**: Potential for increased legal challenges compared to previous administrations.
- **Public Scrutiny**: Heightened media and public attention on immigration policies.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a moderate prior based on historical deportation rates (equivalent n = 5 years).
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Large — Trump's campaign promises and potential policy shifts.
  - ↓ Moderate — Legal and logistical challenges.
  - ↓ Small — Public and international opposition.
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move slightly up, reflecting potential policy shifts but tempered by constraints.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Increased ICE funding and staffing announcements.
  - Executive orders targeting deportations.
  - Cooperation agreements with foreign governments.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Legal injunctions against deportation policies.
  - Public protests and media backlash.
  - Congressional opposition to increased deportation funding.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Uncertainty in Policy Implementation**: Campaign promises may not translate into action.
- **Data Gaps**: Incomplete or delayed reporting of deportation figures.
- **Deception Risks**: Potential for inflated or deflated numbers for political purposes.
- **Regime Changes**: Shifts in political power could alter deportation priorities.
- **Definitional Gotchas**: Changes in what counts as a deportation could skew numbers.

Final Research Summary: While Trump's campaign rhetoric suggests a potential increase in deportations, significant legal, logistical, and political challenges may limit the ability to double FY 2024 numbers in FY 2025.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the probability of at least twice as many deportations by U.S. ICE occurring in Fiscal Year 2025 compared with Fiscal Year 2024, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Historical Deportation Rates**: Under the Trump and Obama administrations, the average annual deportations were approximately 375,000. However, the recent figure for FY 2024 is 271,484 deportations.
    - **Base Rate Selection**: Given the historical context and the recent increase in deportations, a reasonable base rate might be a slight increase from the FY 2024 figure, but not as high as doubling. Thus, a base rate of around 10-20% for doubling seems reasonable, considering historical trends and the challenges of significantly increasing deportations.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarities**: The current situation involves a Republican administration with a focus on increasing deportations, similar to Trump's first term.
    - **Differences**: The explicit promise of mass deportations is more aggressive, but there are significant legal, logistical, and resource constraints that were not as pronounced in previous terms.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **Trump's Campaign Promises**: The likelihood of increased deportations is higher if the event occurs (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)), but translating promises into action is uncertain.
    - **Resource Constraints**: Current ICE resources may not support a doubling, making P(E | ~H) relatively high.
    - **Legal and Public Challenges**: These factors decrease the likelihood of doubling deportations, as they present significant barriers.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    - **Prior Odds**: Let's assume a prior probability of 15% (odds of 0.176).
    - **Likelihood Ratio**: Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio might be slightly above 1 due to campaign promises but tempered by constraints (e.g., 1.2).
    - **Posterior Odds**: 0.176 * 1.2 = 0.211
    - **Posterior Probability**: 0.211 / (1 + 0.211) ≈ 17.4%
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: The forecast might be overconfident in the ability to double deportations given the constraints.
    - **Alternative Scenarios**: A scenario where legal challenges significantly impede deportations could lower the probability.
    - **Rebuttals**: If significant resources are allocated and legal hurdles are overcome, the probability could be higher.
    
    ### 6. Final Forecast
    Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential constraints, the final forecast reflects a modest increase from the prior but remains cautious due to significant barriers.
