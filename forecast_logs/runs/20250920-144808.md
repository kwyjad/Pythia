- **High-Profile Candidates**: Both Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell are well-known, increasing competition.
- **Short Nomination Window**: The quick turnaround may disadvantage less-prepared candidates.
- **Preferential Voting System**: Allows for strategic voting, potentially altering typical outcomes.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a prior favoring established candidates like Phillipson or Powell, with an equivalent n of 30.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Large: Strong endorsements for Phillipson.
  - ↑ Moderate: Powell's media presence and public support.
  - ↓ Small: Potential for a surprise candidate emerging.
- **Net effect**: Posterior should slightly favor Phillipson, given current endorsements and media coverage.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - High-profile endorsements for Phillipson or Powell.
  - Positive media coverage for either candidate.
  - Strong nomination numbers for front-runners.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the outcome of the UK Labour Party's Deputy Leadership election in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    
    - **Bridget Phillipson**: As an established MP with strong party support, the base rate for a front-runner winning is around 60-70%. Given her endorsements and media presence, we start with a prior of 65%.
    - **Lucy Powell**: Similarly, as a well-known MP with media presence, we assign a prior of 60%.
    - **Someone else**: Historically, surprise candidates can emerge, but they are less likely to win in a competitive field with strong front-runners. We assign a prior of 15%.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    
    - **Similarities**: Both Phillipson and Powell fit the profile of established MPs with strong party support, aligning with the typical base case for leadership contests.
    - **Differences**: The sudden resignation of Angela Rayner and the short nomination window create a more unpredictable environment, which could slightly increase the chances for an outsider.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    
    - **Bridget Phillipson**:
      - Strong endorsements: P(E | H) is high, as endorsements are likely if she is the favored candidate.
      - Media coverage: P(E | H) is moderate, as media presence supports her candidacy.
    - **Lucy Powell**:
      - Media presence: P(E | H) is moderate, indicating public support.
      - Endorsements: P(E | H) is moderate, though less strong than Phillipson's.
    - **Someone else**:
      - Surprise emergence: P(E | ~H) is low, as no strong third candidate has emerged yet.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
    
    - **Bridget Phillipson**:
      - Prior odds: 65% / (100% - 65%) = 1.857
      - Likelihood ratio: Strong endorsements and media coverage slightly increase her odds.
      - Posterior odds: 1.857 × 1.2 (for endorsements) = 2.228
      - Posterior probability: 2.228 / (1 + 2.228) ≈ 69%
      
    - **Lucy Powell**:
      - Prior odds: 60% / (100% - 60%) = 1.5
      - Likelihood ratio: Moderate media presence and endorsements.
      - Posterior odds: 1.5 × 1.1 = 1.65
      - Posterior probability: 1.65 / (1 + 1.65) ≈ 62%
    
    - **Someone else**:
      - Prior odds: 15% / (100% - 15%) = 0.176
      - Likelihood ratio: Low due to lack of strong evidence for a third candidate.
      - Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.9 = 0.158
      - Posterior probability: 0.158 / (1 + 0.158) ≈ 14%
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    
    - **Overconfidence**: Ensure not to overestimate the front-runners due to media bias or lack of polling data.
    - **Alternative Scenarios**: Consider the potential for strategic voting or late endorsements shifting dynamics.
    - **Adjustments**: Slightly increase the probability for "Someone else" to account for uncertainty.
    
    ### 6. Final Normalization
    
    Ensure probabilities sum to 100%:
    
    - Bridget Phillipson: 68%
    - Lucy Powell: 60%
    - Someone else: 12%
    
    ### 7. Output Format
    
    Bridget Phillipson: 68%  
    Lucy Powell: 60%  
    Someone else: 12%
