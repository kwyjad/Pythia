### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical US CPI Changes**: Over the past 20 years, the average annual CPI change has been around 2-3%. However, recent years have seen higher volatility.
- **Post-Election Economic Adjustments**: Historically, new administrations often see economic adjustments, with inflation rates fluctuating by ±1-2% in the first year.
- **Global Economic Trends**: Global inflation trends can influence US rates, typically contributing to ±0.5% changes.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-03-06] ↓ — Fact-checking reveals inflation under Biden wasn't the worst, suggesting potential overstatement of current inflation issues.
- [2025-03-04] ↑ — Trump's address to Congress emphasizes economic reforms, potentially increasing inflationary pressures.
- [2024-11-06] ↓ — Economists predict Trump's policies may worsen inflation, indicating potential for higher rates.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Tariffs**: Large — Increased tariffs can raise costs, contributing to inflation.
- **Labor Market**: Moderate — Tighter labor markets can drive wage increases, impacting inflation.
- **Fiscal Policy**: Moderate — Tax cuts and spending can stimulate demand, affecting inflation.
- **Monetary Policy**: Large — Interest rate changes by the Fed can significantly influence inflation.
- **Global Supply Chains**: Moderate — Disruptions can lead to price increases, affecting inflation.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Political Influence**: Trump's active role in monetary policy is atypical and could lead to unconventional inflation outcomes.
- **Tariff Policies**: Current tariff levels are higher than historical norms, potentially driving inflation.
- **Labor Market Dynamics**: Immigration policies are tightening the labor market more than usual.
- **Fiscal Stimulus**: Recent tax cuts are larger than typical post-election adjustments.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a moderate inflation rate decrease, equivalent n = 20 (historical stability).
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Tariffs and labor market pressures (moderate).
  - ↓ Potential fiscal restraint and efficiency measures (small).
  - ↑ Political influence on monetary policy (large).
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move slightly up, indicating a higher likelihood of inflation not decreasing.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Rising tariff levels.
  - Increased wage growth reports.
  - Fed signaling rate hikes.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Announcements of government spending cuts.
  - Improved global supply chain stability.
  - Decrease in consumer demand metrics.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Data Uncertainty**: Economic data revisions can alter inflation perceptions.
- **Policy Changes**: Sudden policy shifts could unpredictably impact inflation.
- **Global Events**: Unforeseen global crises could disrupt economic forecasts.
- **Measurement Issues**: CPI measurement changes could affect comparability.
- **Political Rhetoric**: Statements may not align with actual policy impacts.

Final Research Summary: While historical trends suggest a moderate inflation decrease, current political and economic dynamics, particularly tariffs and labor market pressures, may counteract this, suggesting a slight upward adjustment in inflation expectations.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast whether the 12-month percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be lower in November 2025 than in November 2024, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Historical US CPI Changes**: Historically, the average annual CPI change has been around 2-3%. However, recent years have seen higher volatility, with inflation rates fluctuating more significantly.
    - **Base Rate**: Given the historical average and recent volatility, a reasonable base rate for a decrease in CPI is around 50%, reflecting the uncertainty and equal likelihood of increase or decrease in the absence of strong evidence.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarities**: The current situation involves typical post-election economic adjustments, which historically can lead to fluctuations in inflation.
    - **Differences**: The political influence on monetary policy, higher tariffs, and tighter labor markets are more pronounced than usual, potentially leading to higher inflationary pressures.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **Tariffs and Labor Market Pressures**: These factors are likely to increase inflation, making a decrease less probable. Likelihood ratio suggests a decrease in probability.
    - **Fiscal Restraint and Efficiency Measures**: These could counteract inflationary pressures but are less certain and impactful. Likelihood ratio suggests a slight increase in probability.
    - **Political Influence on Monetary Policy**: Trump's active role could lead to unconventional outcomes, likely increasing inflation. Likelihood ratio suggests a decrease in probability.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    - **Prior Odds**: 1:1 (50% probability)
    - **Likelihood Ratios**:
      - Tariffs and labor market pressures: Decrease probability (e.g., 0.7 likelihood ratio)
      - Fiscal restraint: Slight increase probability (e.g., 1.1 likelihood ratio)
      - Political influence: Decrease probability (e.g., 0.6 likelihood ratio)
    - **Posterior Odds Calculation**:
      - Combined likelihood ratio = 0.7 * 1.1 * 0.6 = 0.462
      - Posterior odds = 1 * 0.462 = 0.462
      - Posterior probability = 0.462 / (1 + 0.462) ≈ 31.6%
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: The forecast might underestimate the potential for fiscal restraint to counteract inflationary pressures.
    - **Tail Risks**: Unforeseen global events or significant policy shifts could drastically alter inflation dynamics.
    - **Alternative Forecast**: A scenario where fiscal measures are more effective than anticipated could lead to a higher probability of CPI decrease.
    
    ### 6. Final Forecast
    - Considering the evidence and potential for unforeseen events, the forecast is adjusted slightly to account for these uncertainties.
    
    Final: 35%
