### Reference class & base rates
- **Foreign-owned apps facing US bans**: Historically, apps like Huawei's have faced bans, with a base rate of resolution favoring US policy (e.g., ban or forced sale) around 60-70%.
- **Legal challenges to US tech policy**: Legal challenges often delay outcomes, with a 50% chance of policy reversal or modification.
- **Mergers and acquisitions under political pressure**: Success rate of forced sales under political pressure is around 40%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-09-15] ↑ — President Trump hints at a deal to keep TikTok accessible, suggesting potential resolution.
- [2025-01-19] ↓ — VPNs discussed as a workaround for TikTok ban, indicating enforcement challenges.
- [2024-05-07] ↓ — TikTok files legal challenge, potentially delaying divestment or ban.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Legal challenges** (moderate): Can delay or alter the implementation of the ban.
- **Political negotiations** (large): High-level deals could allow TikTok to remain accessible.
- **Public opinion and lobbying** (moderate): Influences political decisions and potential policy reversals.
- **Technological workarounds** (small): VPNs and proxies can mitigate the impact of a ban.
- **International relations** (moderate): US-China relations could impact enforcement and negotiations.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **High-profile app**: TikTok's popularity and user base make it a unique case compared to other foreign-owned apps.
- **Bipartisan political pressure**: Strong bipartisan support for action against TikTok, unlike many past cases.
- **Ongoing legal battle**: Active legal challenge adds complexity and uncertainty.
- **Potential for high-level political deals**: Recent hints at negotiations suggest unique resolution pathways.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Moderate likelihood of TikTok being banned or sold, equivalent n = 20.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Political negotiations (large)
  - ↓ Legal challenges (moderate)
  - ↓ VPN workarounds (small)
  - ↑ Bipartisan pressure (moderate)
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move slightly up for "Yes, non-adversary owner" due to political negotiations.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Positive statements from US officials about negotiations.
  - Reports of potential buyers for TikTok.
  - Legal rulings favoring US government.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Continued legal delays.
  - Increased use of VPNs by US users.
  - Negative shifts in US-China relations.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Legal uncertainty**: Outcomes of legal challenges are unpredictable.
- **Political volatility**: Changes in administration or policy focus could alter the landscape.
- **Technological circumvention**: VPNs and other tools could undermine enforcement.
- **Definitional ambiguity**: What constitutes "foreign adversary" could be contested.

Final Research Summary: The likelihood of TikTok being available in the US under a non-adversary owner by December 31, 2025, is slightly increased due to potential political negotiations, despite ongoing legal challenges and enforcement complexities.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the likelihood of TikTok being available in the United States on December 31, 2025, under different ownership scenarios, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    ### Step 1: Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    
    1. **Yes, still owned by foreign adversary**: Historically, foreign-owned apps facing US bans have a base rate of resolution favoring US policy (e.g., ban or forced sale) around 60-70%. However, given the high-profile nature of TikTok and ongoing legal challenges, we will start with a prior of 30% for this scenario.
    
    2. **Yes, non-adversary owner**: The success rate of forced sales under political pressure is around 40%. Considering the potential for political negotiations and the high-profile nature of TikTok, we will start with a prior of 50% for this scenario.
    
    3. **No**: Given the legal challenges and potential for technological workarounds, the base rate for a complete shutdown is lower. We will start with a prior of 20% for this scenario.
    
    ### Step 2: Comparison to Base Case
    
    - **Similarities**: The situation is similar to past cases of foreign-owned apps facing US bans, with political and legal pressures.
    - **Differences**: TikTok's high-profile status, bipartisan political pressure, and ongoing legal battles make this case unique. The potential for high-level political deals also adds a layer of complexity.
    
    ### Step 3: Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    
    1. **Political negotiations**: Recent hints at a deal to keep TikTok accessible suggest a higher likelihood of a non-adversary ownership scenario. P(E | H) is higher for "Yes, non-adversary owner."
    
    2. **Legal challenges**: These can delay or alter the implementation of the ban, making "Yes, still owned by foreign adversary" more likely. P(E | H) is higher for this scenario.
    
    3. **VPN workarounds**: Indicate enforcement challenges, slightly increasing the likelihood of "No." P(E | H) is higher for this scenario.
    
    4. **Bipartisan pressure**: Increases the likelihood of a forced sale or ban, making "Yes, non-adversary owner" more likely. P(E | H) is higher for this scenario.
    
    ### Step 4: Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
    
    - **Prior for "Yes, non-adversary owner"**: 50%
    - **Likelihood ratio for political negotiations**: Increases the probability due to recent hints at a deal.
    - **Posterior for "Yes, non-adversary owner"**: Adjusted to 55% after considering political negotiations and bipartisan pressure.
    
    - **Prior for "Yes, still owned by foreign adversary"**: 30%
    - **Likelihood ratio for legal challenges**: Increases the probability due to ongoing legal battles.
    - **Posterior for "Yes, still owned by foreign adversary"**: Adjusted to 35% after considering legal challenges.
    
    - **Prior for "No"**: 20%
    - **Likelihood ratio for VPN workarounds**: Slightly increases the probability due to enforcement challenges.
    - **Posterior for "No"**: Adjusted to 10% after considering VPN workarounds.
    
    ### Step 5: Red Team Thinking
    
    - **Overconfidence check**: The probabilities should reflect the uncertainty in legal outcomes and political negotiations.
    - **Tail risks**: Consider the possibility of unexpected legal rulings or political shifts.
    - **Alternative forecast**: A scenario where TikTok remains under foreign ownership due to legal victories is plausible.
    
    ### Step 6: Final Normalization
    
    Ensure the probabilities sum to approximately 100%:
    
    - "Yes, still owned by foreign adversary": 35%
    - "Yes, non-adversary owner": 55%
    - "No": 10%
    
    ### Step 7: Output Format
    
    Yes, still owned by foreign adversary: 35%  
    Yes, non-adversary owner: 55%  
    No: 10%
