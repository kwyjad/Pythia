### Reference class & base rates
- **Far-right parties in Europe**: Typically, far-right parties in Europe have seen youth support ranging from 15-25% in recent years. Limitations include varying political landscapes and cultural contexts.
- **Vox's historical youth support**: Historically, Vox's support among young voters has been around 20-25%. Limitations include changing political dynamics and recent events.
- **Youth voting trends in Spain**: Youth voter turnout and preferences can be volatile, with support for different parties fluctuating significantly between elections.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-02-27] ↑ — Vox reaches 27% support among young voters, indicating potential for further growth.
- [2024-06-15] ↑ — Reports of increased youth support for far-right parties across major EU countries, suggesting a broader trend.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Economic dissatisfaction**: Moderate — Economic challenges can drive youth towards populist parties.
- **Cultural identity issues**: Large — Nationalist rhetoric may resonate with youth concerned about cultural changes.
- **Social media influence**: Moderate — Effective use of social media can amplify Vox's reach among young voters.
- **Political polarization**: Large — Increasing polarization can push young voters towards more extreme parties.
- **Youth unemployment**: Moderate — High unemployment rates can lead to disenchantment with traditional parties.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **High current support**: Vox already at 27%, higher than typical far-right youth support.
- **Recent EU trends**: Similar increases in youth support for far-right parties in other EU countries.
- **Media focus**: Increased media attention on Vox's youth support could further boost visibility.
- **Political climate**: Current political polarization in Spain may be more pronounced than in past cycles.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a prior of 20% with an equivalent n of 100 based on historical data.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Large — Current 27% support in recent polls.
  - ↑ Moderate — Broader EU trend of rising far-right youth support.
  - ↑ Moderate — Increased media coverage and social media influence.
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move up moderately, reflecting strong current support and favorable trends.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Increased youth unemployment rates.
  - Rising social media engagement with Vox content.
  - Further polarization in Spanish politics.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Economic improvements reducing dissatisfaction.
  - Emergence of a strong centrist youth movement.
  - Negative media coverage or scandals involving Vox.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Volatility of youth support**: Youth preferences can change rapidly.
- **Polling accuracy**: Potential biases or inaccuracies in polling methods.
- **External shocks**: Unforeseen events could shift political dynamics.
- **Definitional issues**: Variability in defining "far-right" across contexts.

Final Research Summary: Vox's current 27% support among young voters is at the upper end of typical far-right youth support in Europe. Given favorable trends and mechanisms, the probability of surpassing this threshold by the end of 2025 is moderately high.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast whether Vox will surpass the 27% voting intention among young people in Spain by the end of 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - **Base Rate**: Historically, Vox's support among young voters has been around 20-25%. Given the current 27% support, we will use 25% as a reasonable prior, reflecting the upper end of historical support.
       - **Rationale**: This base rate is chosen because it aligns with the historical range of Vox's youth support and accounts for the recent increase to 27%.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - **Similarities**: The current situation reflects a continuation of the trend where far-right parties gain traction among young voters, similar to other European countries.
       - **Differences**: The current 27% support is already at the upper end of typical support levels, suggesting a potential plateau unless further growth drivers are present.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - **Current 27% Support**: This is strong evidence that Vox could maintain or increase its support, as it indicates a high baseline.
         - **Likelihood Ratio**: High likelihood of 27% support if the event occurs (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)).
         - **Impact**: Increases probability.
       - **Broader EU Trend**: Rising youth support for far-right parties across Europe suggests a favorable environment for Vox.
         - **Likelihood Ratio**: Moderate likelihood, as it supports the trend but is not specific to Spain.
         - **Impact**: Increases probability.
       - **Media and Social Media Influence**: Increased visibility and engagement can further boost support.
         - **Likelihood Ratio**: Moderate likelihood, as media influence can be significant but is variable.
         - **Impact**: Increases probability.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - **Prior Odds**: 25% translates to odds of 1:3.
       - **Likelihood Ratio**: Combining evidence, we estimate a likelihood ratio of approximately 2:1 in favor of the event.
       - **Posterior Odds**: 1:3 × 2 = 2:3.
       - **Posterior Probability**: 2 / (2 + 3) = 40%.
       - **Summary**: The probability increases moderately due to strong current support and favorable trends.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the volatility of youth support and potential polling inaccuracies.
       - **Alternative Scenarios**: Economic improvements or a strong centrist movement could reduce Vox's appeal.
       - **Adjustment**: Given these considerations, a slight downward adjustment is prudent to account for uncertainties.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - **Final Probability**: After considering all factors, the probability that Vox will surpass 27% voting intention among young people by the end of 2025 is estimated at 38%.
    
    Final: 38%
