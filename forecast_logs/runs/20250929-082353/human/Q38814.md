### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Economically Significant Agency Rules Challenged in a Skeptical Judicial Circuit:** The FTC's non-compete rule is a major regulation with vast economic implications. When such rules are challenged, particularly in conservative-leaning appellate courts like the Fifth Circuit, their survival rate is low. The Fifth Circuit has a track record of skepticism towards broad federal agency authority. **Base Rate: 20-30% success.** This is derived from the general observation of the Fifth Circuit's jurisprudence on administrative law and the increasing judicial hostility to expansive agency power.
2.  **Agency Rules Implicating the "Major Questions Doctrine":** This judicial doctrine requires agencies to have explicit, clear congressional authorization for regulations of major national significance. The Supreme Court has increasingly invoked this to strike down agency actions (e.g., EPA's Clean Power Plan). The non-compete ban, affecting tens of millions of workers, is a textbook example of a rule vulnerable to this doctrine. **Base Rate: <15% success.** This rate reflects the doctrine's potency and the current Supreme Court's composition.
3.  **Major Agency Rules Defended Across a Presidential Transition:** When a new administration with different policy priorities takes office, it often re-evaluates or abandons the legal defense of controversial rules issued by its predecessor. The likelihood of a rule surviving this transition depends on its political salience and the ideological gap between administrations. **Base Rate: 30-50% survival.** The rate is below 50% because new administrations are keen to reverse the policies of their opponents.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2024-10-18] FTC appeals the district court's decision to the Fifth Circuit. — ↑ — Standard procedural step, but shows the agency's initial commitment to defending the rule.
*   [2025-01-08] FTC files its opening brief in the appeal. — ↑ — A slightly stronger signal of commitment, as it involves expending resources to articulate the legal defense.
*   [2025-07-16] A "reconstituted" FTC requests a 60-day delay to consider dropping its defense of the ban. — ↓↓ — A major negative indicator. It signals a fundamental shift in the FTC's leadership and priorities, likely following a change in presidential administration, and a loss of will to fight for the rule.
*   [2025-09-05] FTC moves to dismiss its own appeals regarding the non-compete rule. — ↓↓↓ — This is a decisive, terminal event. The agency has formally abandoned its legal effort to enact the rule, making its implementation before 2026 impossible through this judicial path.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Judicial Philosophy (Large):** The core driver. The district court's reasoning (lack of statutory authority, "arbitrary and capricious") aligns with a judiciary increasingly skeptical of the administrative state. The Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court are even more likely to hold this view, creating an insurmountable legal barrier.
*   **Change in Administration/FTC Leadership (Large):** The July 2025 request for a delay and the September 2025 motion to dismiss are direct consequences of a "reconstituted" FTC. A change in the White House leads to new agency commissioners who do not share the prior commission's policy goals, leading them to abandon the legal fight.
*   **The Major Questions Doctrine (Large):** This legal doctrine provides the specific tool for courts to strike down the rule. The argument that the FTC is claiming massive, previously unasserted power without explicit direction from Congress is the central and most potent legal challenge.
*   **Statutory Ambiguity (Moderate):** The FTC Act's language regarding "unfair methods of competition" is broad. The lack of specific text authorizing economy-wide rulemaking on employment practices created the vulnerability that challengers exploited.
*   **Organized Opposition (Moderate):** Coordinated legal challenges from business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ensured the rule would face a well-funded, determined, and strategically sophisticated legal battle from day one.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Regulatory Scope:** Unlike most agency rules that target a specific industry, this rule fundamentally altered employment contracts across nearly the entire U.S. economy, elevating its significance and the intensity of the legal opposition.
*   **Judicial Headwinds at a Peak:** The rule was proposed at a time when judicial skepticism of agency power, particularly via the Major Questions Doctrine, is at a modern high point. This is a uniquely hostile environment compared to previous decades.
*   **Direct Agency Capitulation:** It is uncommon for an agency to formally move to dismiss its own appeal of a signature rule. This is not just losing a case; it is a complete surrender, which is a much stronger negative signal than a typical court loss.
*   **Speed of Reversal:** The change in the FTC's stance from filing an appeal brief in January 2025 to moving for dismissal in September 2025 demonstrates a rapid and decisive policy reversal, likely tied directly to the political calendar (i.e., a new administration taking office).

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A low prior of ~15% is appropriate, anchored on the reference class of a major-questions-implicated rule being challenged in the Fifth Circuit. The equivalent n is low (~10), reflecting the unique nature of the rule.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓ (Large) District court vacates the rule, citing lack of authority.
    *   ↑ (Small) FTC files its appeal and opening brief, a pro-forma action.
    *   ↓↓ (Very Large) The "reconstituted" FTC signals its intent to drop the defense. This is strong evidence of a fatal shift in the primary driver (agency will).
    *   ↓↓↓ (Decisive) The FTC formally moves to dismiss its appeal. This resolves the uncertainty and collapses the probability.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior probability should move decisively to near-zero. The initial low prior was strongly confirmed by the final, definitive evidence of the FTC abandoning the rule.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   FTC withdrawing its motion to dismiss the appeal (extremely unlikely).
    *   Congress passing new legislation explicitly granting the FTC this authority (effectively impossible before 2026).
    *   A surprise ruling in a different case that dramatically re-affirms broad agency power (highly improbable).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The Fifth Circuit formally granting the FTC's motion to dismiss, officially ending the case.
    *   Public statements from new FTC commissioners confirming a policy shift away from broad rulemaking towards targeted enforcement.
    *   The White House Office of Management and Budget formally withdrawing the rule.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Source Finality:** The analysis hinges on the provided September 2025 source stating the FTC moved to dismiss its appeal. If this were to be reversed, the forecast would change, but such a reversal is almost unprecedented.
*   **Resolution Criteria Nuance:** The question resolves "No" if the rule is enacted with more than "minor changes." Even if a miracle occurred and the rule survived, any compromise to appease the courts (e.g., exempting more worker classes, removing retroactivity) would likely trigger a "No" resolution.
*   **Alternative Pathways:** The question is specific to the *FTC's proposed ban*. A similar ban enacted via a different mechanism, such as an act of Congress, would not cause this question to resolve "Yes."
*   **Information Lag:** The provided sources are the basis for this brief. Real-world events could have nuances not captured, but based on the provided information, the outcome is clear.

**Final Research Summary:** The FTC has actively moved to dismiss its own appeal, effectively abandoning the non-compete rule. This decision, driven by a change in FTC leadership and insurmountable legal challenges in a skeptical judiciary, makes the rule's enactment in its current form before 2026 a virtual impossibility.

To forecast the probability of the FTC's proposed ban on non-compete agreements being enacted in more or less its current form before 2026, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the success of major agency rules challenged in a skeptical judicial circuit, particularly the Fifth Circuit, is low. Given the reference class of economically significant agency rules challenged in such courts, the base rate is approximately 20-30%. However, considering the specific application of the Major Questions Doctrine and the current judicial climate, a more conservative base rate of 15% is appropriate. This reflects the increasing judicial hostility towards expansive agency power without explicit congressional authorization.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation aligns with the base case of a major agency rule facing legal challenges in a conservative court. The rule's broad scope and economic impact make it a textbook example of a regulation vulnerable to judicial skepticism.
   - Differences: The FTC's rule is unprecedented in its scope, affecting nearly all employment contracts in the U.S., which elevates its significance and the intensity of opposition. Additionally, the FTC's recent actions to dismiss its own appeal indicate a unique and decisive capitulation not typically seen in similar cases.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **District Court Ruling**: The district court's decision to block the rule due to lack of statutory authority and labeling it "arbitrary and capricious" is strong evidence against the rule's enactment. Likelihood ratio significantly favors non-enactment.
   - **FTC's Appeal and Brief**: The FTC's initial appeal and filing of an opening brief are standard procedural steps, offering minimal positive evidence for enactment.
   - **FTC's Request for Delay and Motion to Dismiss**: The request for a delay and subsequent motion to dismiss the appeal are decisive negative indicators. These actions strongly suggest the FTC's abandonment of the rule, drastically reducing the probability of enactment.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 15%, the evidence overwhelmingly supports non-enactment. The FTC's motion to dismiss its appeal is a decisive factor, effectively collapsing the probability of enactment to near-zero.
   - Posterior odds calculation: Prior odds of enactment = 0.15 / 0.85 = 0.176. Given the strong negative evidence, the likelihood ratio is heavily skewed towards non-enactment, leading to a posterior probability approaching 0%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Check: The forecast considers the possibility of reversal or new legislative action, but these are deemed extremely unlikely given the current political and judicial landscape.
   - Alternative Scenarios: The only plausible alternative scenario would involve a dramatic shift in judicial interpretation or new congressional legislation, both of which are improbable before 2026.
   - Adjustments: No adjustments are necessary as the evidence strongly supports the conclusion.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - The final probability reflects the base rate and the overwhelming negative evidence against the rule's enactment.

Final: 0%

# Probability Analysis: FTC Non-Compete Ban Enactment Before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use a base rate focused on major agency rules that face significant legal challenges and involve the "major questions doctrine." This is the most relevant reference class because:

- The FTC non-compete ban is a major economic regulation affecting millions of workers
- It has been challenged on grounds of agency authority overreach
- It has already been struck down by a district court
- It faces review in the conservative Fifth Circuit

Based on historical patterns of similar major agency rules challenged in skeptical judicial circuits and implicating the major questions doctrine, I'll set a prior of **15%**. This reflects the generally low success rate of broad agency regulations that face legal challenges on authority grounds, especially in the current judicial environment.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other major agency rules, this involves questions of statutory authority
- The challenge is proceeding through a conservative-leaning circuit (Fifth Circuit)
- The rule represents a significant economic intervention

**Key differences:**
- The scope is unusually broad, affecting employment contracts across nearly the entire economy
- The district court has already ruled against the FTC, citing lack of authority
- Most critically, the "reconstituted" FTC has requested delays and ultimately moved to dismiss its own appeal

These differences, particularly the FTC's own abandonment of the rule, make this case significantly less likely to succeed than even the low base rate would suggest.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: District court vacated the rule**
- P(E|H): If the rule will be enacted, we would expect some initial legal setbacks but not complete vacatur: ~0.3
- P(E|~H): If the rule won't be enacted, we would expect exactly this kind of judicial rejection: ~0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.8 = 0.375
- This evidence significantly decreases probability

**Evidence 2: FTC filed appeal and opening brief**
- P(E|H): If the rule will be enacted, we would certainly expect the FTC to appeal: ~0.95
- P(E|~H): If the rule won't be enacted, the FTC might still initially appeal as a standard procedure: ~0.7
- Likelihood ratio: 0.95/0.7 = 1.36
- This evidence slightly increases probability

**Evidence 3: "Reconstituted" FTC requested delay to consider dropping defense**
- P(E|H): If the rule will be enacted, this delay request would be extremely unlikely: ~0.05
- P(E|~H): If the rule won't be enacted, this is exactly what we'd expect from a new administration: ~0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.8 = 0.0625
- This evidence dramatically decreases probability

**Evidence 4: FTC moved to dismiss its own appeals**
- P(E|H): If the rule will be enacted, the FTC would never dismiss its own appeal: ~0.01
- P(E|~H): If the rule won't be enacted, this is precisely what we'd expect: ~0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.01/0.9 = 0.011
- This evidence is essentially decisive against enactment

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 15/85 = 0.176

After Evidence 1 (district court vacatur):
- Posterior odds = 0.176 × 0.375 = 0.066
- Posterior probability = 0.066/(1+0.066) ≈ 6.2%

After Evidence 2 (FTC appeal):
- Posterior odds = 0.066 × 1.36 = 0.09
- Posterior probability = 0.09/(1+0.09) ≈ 8.3%

After Evidence 3 (FTC delay request):
- Posterior odds = 0.09 × 0.0625 = 0.0056
- Posterior probability = 0.0056/(1+0.0056) ≈ 0.56%

After Evidence 4 (FTC motion to dismiss):
- Posterior odds = 0.0056 × 0.011 = 0.0000616
- Posterior probability = 0.0000616/(1+0.0000616) ≈ 0.006%

This extremely low probability reflects the decisive nature of the FTC's motion to dismiss its own appeal.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Could there be a political reversal where the FTC withdraws its motion to dismiss? This seems extremely unlikely given the formal nature of the motion.
- Could Congress pass legislation explicitly authorizing the FTC to issue this rule? This would require significant legislative action before 2026, which is highly improbable given current political dynamics.
- Could a different court case establish precedent that somehow revives this rule? This is theoretically possible but practically negligible.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The most plausible alternative is that the FTC might issue a substantially revised rule that is much narrower in scope. However, this would not qualify as "more or less its current form" per the resolution criteria.

**Adjustments:**
- While the mathematical calculation yields essentially zero probability, I should account for unknown unknowns and the inherent uncertainty in complex legal and political processes.
- I'll adjust my final probability to a small but non-zero value to reflect this uncertainty.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the FTC has formally moved to dismiss its own appeal, effectively abandoning the rule, and considering the resolution criteria requiring the rule to be enacted "more or less in its current form," the probability is extremely low. The decisive evidence of the FTC's motion to dismiss its appeal makes enactment before 2026 virtually impossible through the current legal pathway.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is the success rate of major, economically significant agency rules that are challenged in court, particularly when they implicate the "Major Questions Doctrine." This doctrine requires clear congressional authorization for rules with vast economic and political impact. The FTC's non-compete ban is a textbook example.

- **Reference Class:** Major agency rules challenged under the Major Questions Doctrine in a skeptical judicial circuit (like the Fifth Circuit).
- **Reasoning:** The research report suggests a base rate of <15% for such rules, given the current judiciary's skepticism towards broad agency authority. The Fifth Circuit has a track record of ruling against federal agencies in such cases. The rule's unprecedented scope, affecting nearly the entire U.S. economy, places it squarely in the crosshairs of this doctrine.
- **Initial Prior:** I will select a prior probability of **15%**. This reflects the inherently low chance of survival for such an ambitious rule in the current legal environment, even before considering the specific case developments. In odds form, this is approximately 1-to-5.67 in favor of failure.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation aligns perfectly with the base case. The rule is a major regulation with vast economic scope, it relies on a broad interpretation of an old statute ("unfair methods of competition"), it was immediately challenged by well-funded business groups, and the challenge was filed in a jurisdiction (N.D. Texas, appealing to the Fifth Circuit) known to be hostile to federal regulation.
- **Differences:** The primary difference is the rule's extreme political salience. Unlike more technocratic regulations, this rule was a high-profile policy of the administration that issued it. This makes its survival highly dependent on the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, a vulnerability not all major rules share to this degree. This heightened political dependency suggests its odds of survival might be even lower than the 15% base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will update the prior based on the key events described in the research report, which simulates a timeline up to September 2025.

- **Evidence 1: District Court blocks the rule nationwide (Aug 2024).** This is a negative but expected development. Challengers almost always seek and often get preliminary injunctions. However, the court's reasoning—that the FTC lacks statutory authority—is a very strong negative signal for the rule's ultimate survival on appeal. This evidence moderately decreases the probability.
- **Evidence 2: FTC appeals and files its opening brief (Oct 2024 - Jan 2025).** This is a pro-forma action. An agency would not abandon a signature rule after the first loss. This is expected behavior whether the rule ultimately succeeds or fails. This evidence has a negligible impact, slightly increasing the probability by confirming the agency hasn't given up *yet*.
- **Evidence 3: A "reconstituted" FTC requests a delay to consider dropping its defense (July 2025).** This is extremely strong evidence against the rule's survival. "Reconstituted" implies a change in administration and FTC leadership. An agency signaling it may abandon its own rule is a fatal sign. The likelihood ratio P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is very small. This evidence drastically decreases the probability.
- **Evidence 4: FTC moves to dismiss its own appeal (Sep 2025).** This is definitive, terminal evidence. The proponent of the rule is formally surrendering the legal fight. There is no plausible path for this specific FTC rule to be enacted if the FTC itself is asking the court to end the case. The probability of the rule being enacted (H), given that the FTC has moved to dismiss its appeal (E), is virtually zero. P(E|H) ≈ 0.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Initial Prior:** 15%
- **Update 1 (District Court Block):** The prior of 15% is adjusted downwards. The reasoning of the court is ominous for the appeal. Let's say the probability drops to ~12%.
- **Update 2 (FTC Appeal):** This expected action offers no new information and doesn't meaningfully change the ~12% probability.
- **Update 3 (FTC Signals Reversal):** This is the critical update. Starting from ~12% (odds of ~1-to-7.3), we apply the very strong negative evidence. An agency signaling surrender makes enactment incredibly unlikely. The probability plummets to the low single digits, perhaps 1-2%.
- **Update 4 (FTC Moves to Dismiss):** This final piece of evidence resolves nearly all uncertainty. The agency has formally abandoned the rule. The legal vehicle for its enactment is being dismantled by its driver. The posterior probability collapses. The only remaining probability is for "black swan" events, such as the provided information being incorrect or a completely unprecedented legal reversal where a court forces an unwilling agency to defend its rule.

The resulting posterior probability is extremely close to zero.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Could I be wrong?** The primary way this forecast fails is if the information in the research report is inaccurate, specifically the report from September 2025 that the FTC moved to dismiss its appeal. Assuming the information is correct, are there other pathways?
- **Alternative Scenario:** A third party, like a labor union, could try to intervene to defend the rule after the FTC abandons it. This is procedurally very difficult and highly unlikely to succeed, as courts are reluctant to let outside parties take over the government's role in defending its own regulations.
- **Another Scenario:** The FTC could, for some bizarre reason, withdraw its motion to dismiss. This would require another complete leadership change or a shocking political reversal, which is implausible in the short time before the 2026 deadline.
- **Conclusion:** The provided evidence of the FTC's own motion to dismiss is so definitive that it overwhelms all other factors. The path to "Yes" is effectively closed. The remaining uncertainty is minimal and relates to the fidelity of the provided information, not the interpretation of it. A 1% forecast appropriately captures this near-certainty while acknowledging the theoretical possibility of error or an extreme tail-risk event.

### 6. Final Forecast
The initial legal and political hurdles for the non-compete ban were already very high, justifying a low prior probability. The subsequent events, culminating in the FTC itself moving to dismiss its own appeal in September 2025, provide decisive evidence that the agency has abandoned the rule. This action, driven by a change in administration, closes the only plausible pathway for the rule to be enacted before 2026.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**  
An appropriate base rate for this event is drawn from the reference class of major agency rules implicating the "Major Questions Doctrine" and challenged in skeptical judicial circuits like the Fifth Circuit. Historical data shows such rules have a low success rate, often <15%, due to judicial hostility toward expansive agency authority (e.g., Supreme Court cases like the EPA's Clean Power Plan). This is chosen because the FTC's non-compete ban fits this profile: it's a broad, economy-wide regulation without explicit congressional authorization, facing strong legal opposition. Initial prior: 15% (odds 3:17).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**  
Similarities: Like other major rules (e.g., those struck down under the Major Questions Doctrine), this ban involves broad agency overreach on a significant economic issue, challenged in a conservative circuit with a track record of limiting federal power. It's also vulnerable to statutory ambiguity in the FTC Act.  
Differences: This case involves direct agency capitulation via a motion to dismiss its own appeal, which is rarer and more decisive than a typical court loss. Additionally, the rapid reversal tied to a presidential transition amplifies the political shift, making survival even less likely than in base cases without such abandonment.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**  
- District court block (↓): P(E|H) low (if the ban were to succeed, a block is unlikely); P(E|~H) high (expected in hostile courts). Likelihood ratio <1, decreases probability.  
- FTC appeal and brief (↑ small): P(E|H) moderate (shows commitment); P(E|~H) low but possible (pro-forma). Ratio >1, slightly increases probability.  
- Reconstituted FTC delay request (↓↓): P(E|H) very low (signals abandonment, incompatible with success); P(E|~H) high (expected post-transition). Ratio <<1, strongly decreases.  
- FTC motion to dismiss appeal (↓↓↓ decisive): P(E|H) near-zero (agency wouldn't abandon its own rule if enactment were possible); P(E|~H) high (confirms failure). Ratio ≈0.01, massively decreases probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**  
Start with prior odds: 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.176.  
Update for dismissal motion (key decisive evidence, LR ≈0.01): Posterior odds = 0.176 × 0.01 ≈ 0.00176.  
Posterior probability = 0.00176 / (1 + 0.00176) ≈ 0.18%.  
Net: Evidence, especially the abandonment, collapses the probability to near-zero. Uncertainty remains minimal, as the FTC's action is terminal with little room for reversal before 2026.

5. **Red Team Thinking**  
Potential overconfidence: I might underestimate tail risks like the FTC abruptly withdrawing its dismissal motion (e.g., due to internal pressure), though this is extremely unlikely per the report. Alternative scenarios: A surprise court denial of dismissal leading to a fast-tracked win (plausible alternative forecast: 5%), or congressional intervention (but resolution ties to FTC's specific ban). Rebuttals: Voluntary dismissals are routinely granted, no alternative pathways count, and time to 2026 is too short. Adjust to account for tiny uncertainty: cap at <1%, but evidence warrants near-zero.

Final: 0%
