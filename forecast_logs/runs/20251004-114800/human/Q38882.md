### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Liberal Party Historical Trend (2015-2020):** The party's share of women parliamentarians increased from 22.4% to 25.4% over five years. This establishes a base rate of change of **+0.6 percentage points per year**. Extrapolating this linear trend over the five years from the end of 2020 to the end of 2025 would yield a forecast of **28.4%**. This is a strong reference class as it is specific to the party in question but is limited as it predates the significant electoral shifts of 2022.
2.  **Comparable Centre-Right Parties (Westminster Systems):** Centre-right parties in countries like the UK (Conservatives) and Canada (Conservatives) that do not use hard quotas often have female representation in the **25-35% range**. For example, following the 2024 UK election, about 27% of Conservative MPs are women. This class provides a plausible range for a party of this type, suggesting that figures significantly outside this band are unlikely without major structural change.
3.  **Australian Parties Without Quotas (The Nationals):** The Liberal's coalition partner, The Nationals, also resists quotas. Their female representation has historically lagged the Liberals, often sitting below 25%. This suggests that progress without strong interventionist mechanisms is inherently slow and challenging within the Australian political context, reinforcing the lower end of potential outcomes.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-26** (projected) **Queensland State Election** — ↑/↓ (outcome dependent) — The LNP (Liberal National Party) is the opposition. Gains or losses will significantly impact the total number of MPs and the overall percentage, making this the most crucial recent event.
*   **2025-05-13** **Misinformation regarding leadership** — ↔ — A provided source claimed Sussan Ley became the first female leader. This source is a "Rickroll" and is false; Peter Dutton remains leader. This matters as it highlights the potential for misinformation and confirms no recent leadership change has occurred that might accelerate cultural shifts.
*   **2025-03-08** **Western Australia State Election** — ↑ (small) — The WA Liberals, recovering from a near wipeout in 2021, gained a small number of seats. At least two of their new lower house MPs are women, slightly improving their gender balance from a very low base and contributing positively to the national total.
*   **2024-10-27** **Brisbane Lord Mayor Election** — ↑ (small) — While municipal, the re-election of a high-profile LNP administration in Brisbane with several women in key council leadership roles reinforces a positive public image and may support the candidate pipeline.
*   **2024-08-17** **Northern Territory General Election** — ↔ (small) — The Country Liberal Party (CLP

To forecast the percentage of Australia's Liberal parliamentarians who will be women in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The historical trend of the Liberal Party from 2015 to 2020, where the share of women parliamentarians increased from 22.4% to 25.4%, gives a base rate of change of +0.6 percentage points per year. Extrapolating this trend to 2025 suggests a forecast of 28.4%.
- **Reasoning:** This base rate is specific to the party and reflects past progress without quotas, making it a relevant starting point.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The Liberal Party's historical trend provides a realistic baseline for expectations, given the party's resistance to quotas.
- **Difference:** Recent political developments, such as state elections and cultural shifts, may influence the rate of change. However, without significant structural changes like quotas, drastic deviations from the base rate are unlikely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Queensland State Election (2025-10-26):** The outcome could significantly impact the percentage of women MPs. If the LNP gains seats, it could increase the percentage of women, but the exact impact is uncertain.
- **Western Australia State Election (2025-03-08):** The gain of seats, including women MPs, slightly improves the gender balance, suggesting a small positive adjustment.
- **Cultural Resistance to Quotas:** The ongoing resistance to quotas within the party suggests limited acceleration in the trend, reinforcing the base rate's validity.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Update Step:** Starting with the base rate of 28.4%, the small positive impacts from recent elections and the lack of significant structural changes suggest a slight upward adjustment.
- **Posterior Mean:** Adjusting for recent evidence, the mean forecast might increase slightly to around 29-30%.
- **Variance/Spread:** Given the limited evidence for drastic change, the variance remains similar to the base rate, with a slight positive skew.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for potential tail risks, such as unexpected political shifts or policy changes.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A scenario where the party adopts quotas or experiences a significant cultural shift could lead to a higher percentage, but current evidence does not strongly support this.
- **Adjustment:** To account for these considerations, the forecast should slightly widen the spread to capture potential variability.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- Based on the analysis, the final percentiles are adjusted to reflect the slight positive trend and potential variability:

P10: 27  
P20: 28  
P40: 29  
P60: 30  
P80: 31  
P90: 32

# Forecasting the Percentage of Women Liberal Parliamentarians in Australia by 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the historical trend of women's representation in the Liberal Party:
- In 2015: 22.4% women parliamentarians
- In 2020: 25.4% women parliamentarians
- This represents a growth rate of approximately 0.6 percentage points per year

If this trend continued linearly, we would expect approximately 28.4% women by the end of 2025 (25.4% + 5 years × 0.6 percentage points).

I'll use a prior distribution centered at 28.4% with a standard deviation of about 3-4 percentage points, reflecting the uncertainty in the continuation of this trend.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The Liberal Party's organizational structure remains largely unchanged
- The party's cultural resistance to formal quotas continues
- The party still has the same 50% target for 2025 that was established in 2015

**Differences from base case:**
- We're now much closer to the 2025 target date, with limited time for significant change
- The party has had more time to implement recruitment and development programs for women candidates
- Recent electoral cycles may have changed the composition of parliamentarians
- The party may face increased pressure as the deadline approaches

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting higher percentages:**
1. The Liberal Party set an explicit target of 50% women by 2025, creating institutional pressure (moderate upward push, likelihood ratio ~1.5x)
2. The trend from 2015-2020 showed positive momentum, albeit slow (small upward push, likelihood ratio ~1.2x)
3. Comparison to the ALP's 46% women representation demonstrates feasibility within Australian politics (small upward push, likelihood ratio ~1.1x)

**Evidence supporting lower percentages:**
1. The rate of increase from 2015-2020 was only 0.6 percentage points per year, making the 50% target mathematically unrealistic without dramatic intervention (strong downward push from 50% target, likelihood ratio ~0.3x)
2. The Liberal Party's cultural resistance to quotas limits mechanisms for rapid change (moderate downward push from higher targets, likelihood ratio ~0.7x)
3. Centre-right parties in comparable Westminster systems typically have female representation in the 25-35% range (moderate constraint, likelihood ratio ~0.8x for values outside this range)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 28.4%, I'll update based on the evidence:

The strongest evidence is the historical growth rate of 0.6 percentage points per year, which makes reaching anywhere near 50% by 2025 extremely unlikely. This shifts my distribution downward from the target but maintains the upward trajectory from the 2020 baseline.

The cultural resistance to quotas suggests that acceleration beyond historical rates is unlikely, but the institutional pressure of having a public target suggests some continued progress. These factors roughly balance, keeping the mean near the extrapolated trend of 28.4%.

The comparison to other centre-right parties (25-35% range) provides a reasonable constraint on the plausible range, slightly narrowing my distribution.

After these updates, my posterior distribution has:
- Mean/median: approximately 29%
- Narrower standard deviation: approximately 3 percentage points
- Right-skewed: slightly more probability mass below the mean than above it

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for accelerated change as the target date approaches
- I haven't accounted for specific upcoming elections in 2025 that could significantly change the composition
- The Liberal Party might implement stronger measures as the deadline approaches to show progress toward their goal

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Accelerated progress scenario:** The party could implement stronger internal mechanisms (not formal quotas) that significantly increase women's representation, perhaps reaching 35-40%
- **Stagnation scenario:** Electoral losses or internal resistance could stall progress, keeping the percentage near the 2020 level of 25-26%

**Adjustments:**
- I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these scenarios
- I'll shift the upper tail to allow for more possibility of accelerated progress
- I'll ensure my lower bound accounts for the possibility of stagnation

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 24.5
P20: 26.0
P40: 28.0
P60: 30.0
P80: 32.5
P90: 34.5

Answering the question: In 2025, what percent of Australia's Liberal parliamentarians will be women?

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
My primary base rate is the linear trend observed in the Liberal Party's female representation from 2015 to 2020. During this period, the share of women parliamentarians (across all Australian parliaments) increased from 22.4% to 25.4%. This represents a slow but steady increase of 3.0 percentage points over five years, or an average of +0.6 percentage points per year.

Extrapolating this trend from the end-of-2020 figure of 25.4% for the five years until the end of 2025 would yield a forecast of **28.4%** (25.4% + 5 * 0.6%). I will use this as the initial center of my prior distribution.

For the spread, I will use a secondary reference class: comparable centre-right parties in other Westminster systems (e.g., UK, Canada) that do not use quotas. These parties typically have female representation in the **25-35% range**. This suggests my prior distribution should have most of its mass within this range, making the 28.4% median plausible and indicating that outcomes below 25% or above 35% are unlikely without significant structural change.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The situation today has similarities and crucial differences compared to the 2015-2020 period.

*   **Similarities:** The Liberal Party's institutional culture remains largely resistant to enforceable quotas, which was the primary reason for the slow progress observed in the base rate period. This institutional inertia is a powerful force maintaining the status quo.
*   **Differences:** The 2022 federal election was a significant structural break. The party lost many urban seats, often held by men, to "Teal" independents (many of whom are women). This electoral shock had the paradoxical effect of increasing the percentage of women within the smaller federal Liberal party room. As of mid-2024, federal Liberal representation is approximately 29.5% female, already above my extrapolated prior. This event makes the simple linear trend from 2015-2020 an unreliable predictor and suggests the baseline has been reset higher.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will update my prior based on the new baseline and upcoming events before the January 1, 2026 resolution date.

*   **Evidence 1: Post-2022 Election Baseline (Strong Upward Pressure):** The current federal Liberal party room composition of ~29.5% women is a hard data point and a large component of the national total. State-level data (e.g., Queensland LNP at ~29.4% women) corroborates this. This evidence strongly suggests the true national figure is currently around 29-30%, significantly higher than the 28.4% prior. This pushes the entire distribution upwards.

*   **Evidence 2: 2025 Federal Election (Moderate Upward Pressure):** A federal election is due by May 2025. The political dynamics strongly suggest this event will increase female representation.
    *   If the Liberals lose more seats to Teal-style independents or Labor, the seats lost are often in urban areas, and the effect could be similar to 2022, increasing the percentage of women among the remaining MPs.
    *   If the Liberals are to win back seats, particularly from the Teals, they are under immense pressure to preselect strong female candidates.
    *   This dynamic creates an asymmetric effect, where most plausible federal election outcomes lead to a slight-to-moderate increase in the percentage of women. This provides a further upward push to my forecast.

*   **Evidence 3: October 2025 Queensland State Election (Adds Variance):** This is the last major electoral event. The LNP (Liberal National Party) is competitive.
    *   An LNP win would add a large number of new MPs to the national total. If this new cohort has a high proportion of women (>30%), it will pull the national average up.
    *   However, if they win with a cohort that has poor gender balance (<29%), it could slightly pull the national average down.
    *   An LNP loss would result in little change.
    *   This event primarily adds variance and a slight upward skew to the forecast, as the party is under pressure to preselect more women, making a high-percentage intake more likely than a very low one.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My process is as follows:
1.  **Prior Median:** 28.4% (from 2015-2020 trend).
2.  **Update with New Baseline:** The post-2022 evidence of a ~29.5% baseline is a major update. This shifts my posterior median to at least 29.5%.
3.  **Update with 2025 Elections:** The likely asymmetric, positive impact of the federal election pushes the median further up. I estimate this will move the center of my distribution to around 31%. The Queensland election then adds variance around this new central point. A good outcome could push the final number towards 33%, while a poor outcome could pull it back towards 30%.

My final posterior distribution is centered at approximately 31%, which is higher than the current baseline, reflecting the likely impact of the 2025 federal election. The spread reflects the uncertainty of the specific outcomes of both the federal and Queensland elections.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be wrong if I overestimate the party's ability or willingness to change. The "best alternative forecast" would be one of stagnation, where the percentage remains around the current 29.5%. This could happen if:
1.  The Liberals defy political gravity and win back federal seats with a slate of mostly male candidates.
2.  The LNP wins in Queensland, but pre-selections in rural and safe seats result in a new cohort with a poor gender balance (~25% women), dragging the national average down.
3.  A number of incumbent female MPs retire and are replaced by men.

While plausible, I believe the intense media and political focus on the Liberals' "woman problem," especially after the 2022 election, makes this stagnation scenario less likely than one of forced, incremental improvement. The risk of stagnation or slight backsliding is real, however, and I have accounted for it by setting my P10 and P20 percentiles below 30%. My upper percentiles (P80, P90) reflect a scenario where the party makes a concerted and successful effort in both elections, pushing the figure into the low 30s, which is consistent with the range of comparable international parties.

### 6. Final Percentiles
P10: 28.8
P20: 29.4
P40: 30.2
P60: 31.8
P80: 32.8
P90: 33.8
