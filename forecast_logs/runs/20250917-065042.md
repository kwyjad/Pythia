### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical Deportation Rates**: Average annual deportations under Trump (375,000) and Obama (375,000) administrations. Limitations: Policy shifts and external factors like pandemics can skew comparisons.
- **Recent Trends**: FY 2024 saw 271,484 deportations, a 43% increase from FY 2023. Limitations: Recent political changes may not reflect long-term trends.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2024-11-19] ↑ — Trump's campaign promises mass deportations, potentially increasing deportation efforts.
- [2024-12-05] ↓ — Experts highlight resource constraints for mass deportations, limiting feasibility.
- [2025-06-17] ↓ — Reports of high costs and logistical challenges in executing large-scale deportations.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Political Will**: Large — Presidential directives can significantly influence ICE operations.
- **Resource Allocation**: Moderate — Funding and staffing levels directly impact deportation capacity.
- **Public Opinion**: Small — Shifts in public sentiment can affect policy implementation.
- **Legal Challenges**: Moderate — Court rulings can delay or halt deportation efforts.
- **International Relations**: Small — Cooperation with other countries affects deportation logistics.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Increased Political Pressure**: Trump's renewed focus on deportations contrasts with previous administrations.
- **Resource Constraints**: Current ICE capacity may not support doubling deportations without significant investment.
- **Legal Environment**: Potential for increased legal challenges compared to past administrations.
- **Public Scrutiny**: Heightened media attention and public debate on immigration policies.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a moderate likelihood of increased deportations, equivalent to n=10 based on historical trends.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Political pressure (large)
  - ↓ Resource constraints (moderate)
  - ↓ Legal challenges (moderate)
  - ↓ Logistical challenges (small)
- **Net effect**: Posterior should slightly decrease due to significant logistical and legal barriers.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Increased ICE funding and staffing.
  - New executive orders prioritizing deportations.
  - Cooperation agreements with foreign governments.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Legal injunctions against deportation policies.
  - Reports of ICE resource shortages.
  - Public protests or backlash against deportation policies.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Uncertainty in Political Commitment**: Campaign promises may not translate into action.
- **Data Gaps**: Incomplete or delayed reporting on deportation figures.
- **Deception Risks**: Potential for misreporting or manipulation of deportation statistics.
- **Regime Changes**: Shifts in administration could alter policy direction.
- **Definitional Gotchas**: Changes in what counts as a deportation could affect numbers.

Final Research Summary: While political pressure suggests a potential increase in deportations, significant logistical, legal, and resource constraints make it unlikely that deportations will double in FY 2025 compared to FY 2024.

## Per-model

- **OpenRouter-Default** ok=True time=12614ms cost=$13.7925 parsed=0.02

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for deportations doubling from one fiscal year to the next is historically low. Under the Trump administration, the average annual deportations were around 375,000, and under Obama, they were similar. The increase from FY 2023 to FY 2024 was 43%, which is significant but far from doubling. Therefore, a reasonable base rate for doubling deportations in a single year might be around 5%, reflecting the rarity of such a large increase historically.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The current situation involves a political administration (Trump) that has expressed strong intentions to increase deportations, similar to past administrations that have prioritized immigration enforcement.
       - Differences: The logistical, legal, and resource constraints are more pronounced now, with experts highlighting the challenges of executing mass deportations. Additionally, the political and public environment may be more contentious, with potential for increased legal challenges and public protests.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Political Pressure: The likelihood of increased deportations given Trump's campaign promises is high (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)), but the actual execution depends on overcoming significant barriers.
       - Resource Constraints: Reports of resource limitations suggest that doubling deportations is less likely (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)).
       - Legal Challenges: The potential for legal injunctions decreases the likelihood of doubling deportations (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)).
       - Logistical Challenges: High costs and logistical issues further decrease the likelihood (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)).
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds = 5% / 95% = 0.0526
       - Likelihood ratio for political pressure = 1.5 (increases probability)
       - Likelihood ratio for resource constraints = 0.5 (decreases probability)
       - Likelihood ratio for legal challenges = 0.5 (decreases probability)
       - Likelihood ratio for logistical challenges = 0.7 (decreases probability)
       - Combined likelihood ratio = 1.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.7 = 0.2625
       - Posterior odds = 0.0526 * 0.2625 = 0.0138
       - Posterior probability = 0.0138 / (1 + 0.0138) ≈ 1.36%
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence Risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for political will to overcome barriers. However, historical data and current constraints suggest this is unlikely.
       - Alternative Scenario: A significant increase in ICE funding and staffing could change the outlook, but current reports do not indicate this is happening.
       - Rebuttal: Even with increased funding, legal and logistical challenges remain significant hurdles.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the probability of deportations doubling in FY 2025 compared to FY 2024 remains low.
    
    Final: 2%

### Reference class & base rates
- **Incumbent Mayors in Minneapolis**: Since 2000, incumbents have been re-elected 60% of the time. Limitations: This rate may not fully capture the dynamics of a ranked-choice election or the impact of a strong party endorsement.
- **Democratic Mayors in Minneapolis**: The city has been led by Democratic mayors for over 47 years, suggesting a high base rate for Democratic candidates.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-07-24] ↑ — Omar Fateh received the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party endorsement, boosting his profile.
- [2025-05-XX] ↑ — Poll shows Mayor Frey with a -21% net favorability, indicating potential vulnerability.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Party Endorsement**: Large — DFL endorsement significantly boosts Fateh's visibility and resources.
- **Incumbent Favorability**: Moderate — Frey's low favorability could drive voters towards Fateh.
- **Ranked-Choice Voting**: Moderate — This system may benefit candidates with strong initial support.
- **National Attention**: Small — Increased media coverage could attract more campaign funding.
- **Progressive Momentum**: Moderate — Growing support for progressive candidates nationally may influence local outcomes.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **DFL Endorsement**: Unusual for a challenger to receive party endorsement over an incumbent.
- **Ranked-Choice Voting**: Different electoral dynamics compared to traditional voting systems.
- **Progressive vs. Moderate**: Clear ideological divide, unlike some past elections.
- **National Attention**: More media focus than typical for a local race.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Given the historical re-election rate of 60% for incumbents, a prior favoring Frey is reasonable (equivalent n = 5).
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Large: DFL endorsement for Fateh.
  - ↑ Moderate: Frey's low favorability.
  - ↑ Moderate: Progressive momentum nationally.
  - ↓ Small: Incumbency advantage for Frey.
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move significantly towards Fateh due to strong recent evidence favoring him.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Increased campaign funding for Fateh.
  - Additional endorsements from key local figures.
  - Positive shifts in public polling for Fateh.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Successful appeal by Frey regarding DFL endorsement.
  - Improvement in Frey’s favorability ratings.
  - Emergence of a strong third-party candidate.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Polling Uncertainty**: Limited public polling data available.
- **Ranked-Choice Complexity**: Outcomes can be unpredictable.
- **Media Influence**: National attention may skew local perceptions.
- **Appeal Outcome**: Frey's appeal could alter the dynamics.
- **Voter Turnout**: Uncertain turnout rates could impact results.

Final Research Summary: Omar Fateh's chances of being elected mayor have increased due to the DFL endorsement and Frey's low favorability. However, uncertainties in polling and the ranked-choice system remain significant factors.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the probability of Omar Fateh being elected mayor of Minneapolis in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Base Rate for Incumbent Re-election**: Historically, incumbent mayors in Minneapolis have been re-elected 60% of the time. This suggests a prior probability of 60% for the incumbent, Jacob Frey, being re-elected.
    - **Base Rate for Democratic Candidates**: Minneapolis has been led by Democratic mayors for over 47 years, indicating a high likelihood for a Democratic candidate to win. However, since both candidates are Democrats, this does not differentiate between them.
    
    **Initial Prior**: Given the incumbent re-election rate, we start with a prior of 60% for Frey and 40% for Fateh.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarity**: The election involves an incumbent, similar to past elections.
    - **Differences**:
      - **DFL Endorsement**: Unusually, the challenger, Fateh, has received the party endorsement over the incumbent.
      - **Ranked-Choice Voting**: This system can alter traditional dynamics, potentially benefiting candidates with strong initial support.
      - **Frey's Low Favorability**: Frey's current -21% net favorability is significantly lower than in previous elections.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **DFL Endorsement**: Strongly favors Fateh. Likelihood ratio significantly greater than 1.
    - **Frey's Low Favorability**: Suggests vulnerability. Likelihood ratio moderately greater than 1.
    - **Progressive Momentum**: National trend towards progressive candidates. Likelihood ratio moderately greater than 1.
    - **Incumbency Advantage**: Typically favors Frey, but weakened by other factors. Likelihood ratio slightly less than 1.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    - **Prior Odds for Fateh**: 40% / 60% = 0.67
    - **Likelihood Ratio**: Considering the strong DFL endorsement and Frey's low favorability, we estimate a likelihood ratio of about 2.5 in favor of Fateh.
    - **Posterior Odds**: 0.67 * 2.5 = 1.675
    - **Posterior Probability for Fateh**: 1.675 / (1 + 1.675) ≈ 62.6%
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: The forecast might overestimate Fateh's chances if Frey's appeal succeeds or if his favorability improves.
    - **Tail Risks**: A strong third-party candidate could emerge, or voter turnout could be unpredictable.
    - **Alternative Forecast**: If Frey's appeal is successful, his chances could increase significantly.
    
    ### 6. Final Forecast
    Considering the evidence and potential uncertainties, the probability that Omar Fateh will be elected mayor of Minneapolis in 2025 is adjusted to reflect the strong endorsement and current political climate, while accounting for the inherent uncertainties in the electoral process.
    
    Final: 63%
