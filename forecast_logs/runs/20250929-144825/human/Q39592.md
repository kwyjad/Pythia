### Reference class & base rates
- **Long-Term Historical Average (1997-2025):** The long-term mean for the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS is approximately 5.24%. The median is lower, likely around 4.50%, due to right-skewness from crisis periods (e.g., 2008, 2020). Using this class suggests a strong pull towards a higher spread than the current level. *Limitation: This class includes multiple recessions and periods with vastly different credit quality composition in the index.*
- **Non-Recessionary Economic Expansions (Post-GFC):** In periods of stable, positive economic growth without imminent recession fears (e.g., 2012-2018), the spread has typically traded in a range of 3.25% to 5.00%. This class is more representative of a "normal" risk environment than the full history. *Limitation: The current macroeconomic environment, characterized by higher inflation and interest rates than that period, may not be a perfect analogue.*
- **Recent "Tight Spread" Regime (2021-Present, excluding early 2022 volatility):** In the post-pandemic recovery and subsequent "soft landing" narrative, spreads have frequently been anchored in a 2.75% to 4.00% range. The current reading of ~2.76% is at the very bottom of this recent regime. This class reflects current market structure and sentiment. *Limitation: This is a short, potentially anomalous period, and may not be sustainable.*

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The horizon is less than 3 months, so the focus is on the last 6 months (April-September 2025).
- **2025-09-26** Current OAS level reported at 2.76%. — (↓) — Confirms spreads are near historical lows, reflecting high investor confidence and a strong "risk-on" sentiment heading into Q4.
- **2025-09-01** September OAS reported at 2.70%. — (↓) — Indicates that the tight spread environment has been persistent through the end of Q3, setting a very low baseline for the forecast period.
- **2025-08-15** (Implied) Summer trading likely saw low volatility. — (↔) — A typical quiet summer period with no major shocks would have allowed fundamentals to dominate, keeping spreads stable and tight, consistent with the September readings.
- **2025-06-24** Lord Abbett report notes resilience despite early 2025 volatility. — (↓) — Suggests the market has absorbed earlier macro fears, and the prevailing narrative is one of fundamental strength, supporting continued tight spreads.
- **2025-05-15** (Implied) Q1 earnings season likely concluded positively. — (↓) — Given the optimistic mid-year reports, corporate earnings and forward guidance in the spring must have been strong enough to justify the positive credit outlook.
- **2025-04-01** (Implied) Economic data continues to support a "soft landing" narrative. — (↓) — Persistent data showing moderating inflation without a sharp economic contraction would have calmed recession fears, compressing risk premia in credit markets.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Corporate Default Rate Expectations:** The primary driver. Lower expected defaults, driven by strong corporate balance sheets and earnings, reduce the compensation investors demand for credit risk. *Impact: Large.*
- **Macroeconomic Growth Outlook:** GDP growth expectations directly influence corporate revenue and default risk. A "soft landing" or resilient growth scenario is bullish for credit (spreads down), while recession fears are bearish (spreads up). *Impact: Large.*
- **Federal Reserve Monetary Policy:** The path of the Fed Funds rate and quantitative tightening affects borrowing costs and overall economic activity. A dovish pivot or pause supports credit; hawkishness or surprise hikes pressure it. *Impact: Moderate to Large.*
- **Market Risk Sentiment (VIX, etc.):** Broader "risk-on" or "risk-off" sentiment can drive flows into or out of high-yield bonds, causing spreads to tighten or widen independently of fundamentals in the short term. *Impact: Moderate.*
- **Technical Factors (Supply/Demand):** The balance between new high-yield bond issuance and investor demand (e.g., from those seeking higher yields than government bonds) can influence spreads. Modest issuance and strong demand are supportive. *Impact: Small to Moderate.*
- **Treasury Yield Volatility:** High volatility in the "risk-free" rate can spill over into credit markets, causing risk premia to widen as a buffer against uncertainty. *Impact: Small to Moderate.*

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Higher Index Credit Quality:** Multiple sources (Lord Abbett, AXA IM) confirm a structural shift. The high-yield index now has a significantly higher concentration of BB-rated bonds (the highest quality tier of junk) and a near 20-year low allocation to CCC-rated bonds (the riskiest). This structurally justifies a lower spread than the long-term historical average.
- **Strong Corporate Fundamentals:** Unlike many past periods of tight spreads that were fueled by cheap leverage, current corporate balance sheets are reported to be strong, with leverage below and interest coverage ratios above historical averages (Northern Trust). This provides a robust cushion against a mild slowdown.
- **Benign and Low Default Projections:** Consensus forecasts from multiple asset managers (Northern Trust, AXA IM) project default rates for 2025 to remain in the 1-3% range, well below the historical average of ~4%. This is a powerful force anchoring spreads at low levels.
- **Extremely Low Starting Point:** The current spread of ~2.76% is already near the record low of 2.41% (June 2007). This creates an asymmetry; there is far more room for spreads to widen on negative news than to tighten further on positive news.
- **Elevated "All-in" Yields:** With Treasury yields higher than in the last decade, the effective yield on high-yield bonds (~6.42% in Sept 2025) is attractive to income-seeking investors, creating strong technical demand that helps keep spreads tight, even if they offer little compensation for risk relative to history.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** A reasonable prior could be a distribution centered near the recent low values, perhaps around 3.00%, reflecting the persistence of the current regime but allowing for some mean reversion. An equivalent n of ~20 would represent moderate confidence in this starting point.
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - (↓ Large) The structural improvement in the index's credit quality is a persistent factor justifying a permanently lower baseline spread.
    - (↓ Large) The consensus forecast for continued low default rates through 2025, backed by strong corporate fundamentals, removes the primary catalyst for spread widening.
    - (↓ Moderate) Strong technical support from investors seeking attractive all-in yields provides a floor for prices and a cap on spreads.
    - (↑ Moderate) The extremely tight starting point (~2.76%) creates a significant risk of mean reversion. Any negative catalyst could cause a sharp upward move.
    - (↑/↓ Small) The forecast period (Oct 13-24) coincides with the heart of Q3 earnings season, which introduces potential for idiosyncratic volatility from major issuers, creating two-sided risk.
- **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly supports spreads remaining well below the long-term average. The posterior should be heavily anchored near the current level (~2.75% - 3.25%). The update should slightly increase the probability of a move higher versus a move lower, reflecting the asymmetric risk from the low starting point, but the central tendency should remain low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators (spreads widen):**
    - A spike in the VIX index above 20.
    - Negative pre-announcements or guidance from large BB-rated issuers during early Q3 earnings.
    - An unexpected increase in weekly initial jobless claims, suggesting a crack in the labor market.
    - Hawkish commentary from Fed officials pushing back against market expectations for future policy.
    - A significant geopolitical flare-up that triggers a global "risk-off" move.
- **DOWN indicators (spreads tighten further):**
    - Broadly positive Q3 earnings reports showing margin resilience and strong forward guidance.
    - A key inflation print (e.g., CPI) coming in well below expectations, cementing the "soft landing" narrative.
    - A notable credit rating upgrade for a large high-yield issuer.
    - Strong inflows into high-yield bond funds.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Event Risk:** The forecast is for a specific two-week window. A single unexpected event (geopolitical, major corporate default, market flash crash) could dramatically alter the outcome.
- **Mean Reversion Gravity:** Spreads this far below their long-term average can be prone to sharp, rapid corrections. The market may be complacent, and a small shock could have an outsized impact.
- **Lagged Policy Effects:** The full economic impact of monetary tightening over the last 1-2 years may not have fully materialized. A sudden slowdown could catch the credit market by surprise.
- **"Priced for Perfection":** The current tight spread implies the market is expecting a near-perfect economic outcome. Any deviation from this rosy scenario could lead to a repricing of risk (wider spreads).
- **Data Illusions:** The provided sources are expert opinions and forecasts. While forming a strong consensus, they are not guaranteed. A shift in this consensus would be a major indicator.

### Final Research Summary
The high-yield spread is expected to remain near its current historically low levels, anchored by exceptionally strong corporate credit quality and a benign default outlook. However, with the market already priced for a positive outcome, risks are asymmetric to the upside (wider spreads) should any negative economic or earnings surprises emerge during the mid-October resolution period.

To forecast the ending value of the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) for the biweekly period of October 13 - October 24, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate for this forecast is the recent "Tight Spread" regime (2021-Present), where spreads have been in the range of 2.75% to 4.00%. The current level is 2.76%, which is at the lower end of this range.
- **Justification:** This period reflects the current market sentiment and structure, characterized by strong corporate fundamentals and low default expectations. The mean of this base rate is around 3.00%, with a variance reflecting the range from 2.75% to 4.00%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current economic environment continues to support tight spreads, with strong corporate balance sheets and low default expectations.
- **Differences:** The starting point of 2.76% is extremely low, creating potential for mean reversion. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment includes higher inflation and interest rates than in previous periods of tight spreads.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Structural Improvement in Credit Quality:** Justifies a lower baseline spread (↓ Large).
- **Low Default Rate Projections:** Supports continued tight spreads (↓ Large).
- **Technical Demand for High Yields:** Provides a floor for spreads (↓ Moderate).
- **Extremely Low Starting Point:** Increases risk of upward movement (↑ Moderate).
- **Potential Earnings Volatility:** Introduces two-sided risk (↑/↓ Small).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered around 3.00%, reflecting the tight spread regime.
- **Evidence Impact:** The evidence supports maintaining a low spread, but the risk of mean reversion and potential earnings volatility slightly increases the probability of a higher spread.
- **Posterior:** The distribution remains anchored near the current level, with a slight upward skew due to asymmetric risks.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Risk:** The forecast could underestimate the potential for a sharp correction if negative news emerges.
- **Tail Risks:** Consider geopolitical events or unexpected economic data that could widen spreads.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A sudden economic slowdown or hawkish Fed stance could lead to a significant spread widening.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- **Adjusted Percentiles:** Reflecting the evidence and potential risks, the forecast percentiles are slightly adjusted upwards from the current level, but remain within the tight spread regime.

P10: 2.80  
P20: 2.85  
P40: 2.95  
P60: 3.05  
P80: 3.20  
P90: 3.35

# Forecasting ICE BofA US High Yield OAS for Oct 13-24, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my base rate, I'll use the "Recent Tight Spread Regime" (2021-Present) as my primary reference class, with the current reading of 2.76% as a key anchor point. This is the most relevant reference class because:

- It reflects the current market structure with improved credit quality in the index
- It captures the post-pandemic monetary policy environment
- It incorporates the "soft landing" narrative that appears to be prevailing

The mean of this regime is approximately 3.25%, with a typical range of 2.75% to 4.00%. The distribution is likely right-skewed, with a median closer to 3.00%.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Strong corporate fundamentals with healthy balance sheets
- Low default rate expectations (1-3% range)
- Improved credit quality of the high-yield index (more BB-rated bonds)
- Persistent investor demand for yield

**Differences from base case:**
- Current spread (2.76%) is at the very bottom of the recent range
- The forecast period coincides with Q3 earnings season, which introduces volatility
- Spreads this tight have historically been difficult to maintain for extended periods
- The market appears to be "priced for perfection" with little room for further tightening

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting tighter or stable spreads:**
- Structural improvement in index credit quality (↓ Large) - Makes lower spreads more justified than historical averages
- Consensus forecasts for continued low default rates (↓ Moderate) - Reduces the risk premium investors demand
- Strong corporate fundamentals with good interest coverage (↓ Moderate) - Supports continued low default expectations
- Attractive "all-in" yields creating technical support (↓ Small) - Helps maintain investor demand

**Evidence supporting wider spreads:**
- Extremely tight starting point of 2.76% (↑ Large) - Creates asymmetric risk to the upside
- Q3 earnings season timing (↑ Small to Moderate) - Introduces potential volatility
- Mean reversion tendency of credit spreads (↑ Moderate) - Historical pattern suggests some widening from extreme lows
- Lagged effects of monetary tightening (↑ Small) - Could begin to impact corporate performance

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior centered around 3.00% (slightly above current level), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update 1: Structural improvement in index quality**
- This makes the lower end of the range more likely
- Shifts the distribution leftward by ~0.25%, centering it closer to 2.85%
- Reduces the right tail somewhat

**Update 2: Extremely tight starting point and mean reversion**
- This makes some widening more likely than further tightening
- Adds more weight to the 2.80-3.50% range
- Creates a slight right skew in the distribution

**Update 3: Q3 earnings season timing**
- Increases the variance of the distribution
- Adds more probability to both tails (potential for volatility)
- Maintains the central tendency around 2.90-3.00%

The posterior distribution is now centered around 2.95%, with a right skew and moderately increased variance compared to the prior.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the persistence of the current tight spread regime
- The forecast period is short (2 weeks), which limits the potential for major moves
- I might be overweighting mean reversion when structural factors could keep spreads tight longer

**Tail risks:**
- Upside (wider spreads): A major geopolitical event, unexpected Fed hawkishness, or significant negative earnings surprises could cause spreads to widen sharply, potentially to 4-5% range
- Downside (tighter spreads): Exceptionally strong earnings and economic data could push spreads to new post-GFC lows, potentially testing the 2.40-2.50% range

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would center the distribution lower, around 2.75-2.80%, arguing that the structural improvements and technical factors will dominate over mean reversion in this short timeframe. The counterargument is that spreads this tight historically have very limited room to compress further and are vulnerable to even minor negative catalysts.

After consideration, I'll slightly widen my uncertainty bands to account for these tail risks, while maintaining the central tendency.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 2.55%
P20: 2.65%
P40: 2.85%
P60: 3.05%
P80: 3.35%
P90: 3.75%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
Given the short forecast horizon (less than one month from the report's date of 2025-09-29 to the resolution period of Oct 13-24), the most relevant base rate is the recent behavior of the series. I will select the "Recent Tight Spread Regime" (2021-Present) as my primary reference class.

- **Reference Class:** Recent Tight Spread Regime (2021-Present, excluding major volatility spikes).
- **Rationale:** This period reflects the current market structure, investor sentiment, and macroeconomic backdrop (post-pandemic recovery, higher rates). The long-term historical average (mean ~5.24%) is less relevant due to structural changes in the high-yield index's credit quality and different economic conditions.
- **Distribution:** This regime has seen spreads typically trade between 2.75% and 4.00%. My prior distribution will be centered near the most recent value (2.76%), reflecting the high persistence of this metric over short timeframes. I'll assume a median around 2.90% with a standard deviation of approximately 0.30%, incorporating a slight upward drift due to mean reversion pressure and a right skew, as spreads have more room to rise than fall.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The forecast period is expected to be a continuation of the current environment. The "soft landing" narrative, supported by strong corporate fundamentals and low default forecasts, remains the dominant driver, consistent with the entire recent regime.
- **Differences:** The primary difference is the starting point. At ~2.76%, the spread is at the absolute low end of the recent range and near historical lows. This creates a significant asymmetry: any negative news has a much larger potential impact (widening spreads) than positive news (tightening spreads further). The forecast period also coincides with the Q3 earnings season, which introduces event-driven volatility not always present in the base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will update my prior based on several key pieces of evidence from the report:

- **Structural Improvement in Index Quality:** The report notes a higher concentration of higher-quality BB-rated bonds and fewer risky CCC-rated bonds. This is a strong, persistent factor that justifies a lower baseline spread. This evidence significantly lowers the likelihood of outcomes above 4.00%, pushing the entire distribution down compared to long-term history.
- **Benign Default Outlook:** Consensus forecasts for 2025 default rates are in the 1-3% range, well below the historical average (~4%). This is the core fundamental support for tight spreads. This evidence makes a significant spread widening (e.g., to 4.50%+) highly improbable without a major, unforeseen shock.
- **Extremely Low Starting Point (~2.76%):** This is the most critical factor for shaping the distribution. It makes further significant tightening very unlikely (e.g., below 2.50%). Conversely, it increases the relative likelihood of a sharp move upward on any negative news. This introduces a strong right skew to the forecast distribution. Likelihood ratio: A 50 bps move up is perhaps 3-4x more likely than a 50 bps move down from here.
- **Q3 Earnings Season:** This introduces two-sided risk during the resolution period. However, given the market is "priced for perfection," negative surprises are likely to have an outsized impact compared to positive ones. This increases the variance of the forecast and further fattens the right tail (wider spreads).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Conceptual Update:** Posterior ∝ Prior(centered near 2.90%, right-skewed) × Likelihoods(strong support for low spreads, but with asymmetric upside risk).
- **Update Process:**
    1.  My prior is centered near the current low levels (~2.90%) but allows for some mean reversion.
    2.  The strong evidence on fundamentals (credit quality, low defaults) confirms that the distribution should remain anchored at low levels, far from the historical mean of 5.24%. This trims the extreme right tail.
    3.  The evidence of the very low starting point and earnings season risk forces a significant adjustment to the distribution's shape. I will stretch the right side of the distribution while compressing the left side.
- **Posterior Shape:** The resulting posterior distribution has a mode very close to the current value (~2.80%), but the median is pulled slightly higher to ~2.90% due to the asymmetric risk. The mean is pulled even higher (~3.00%) by the skewed tail. The distribution is narrow on the left (downside) and wide on the right (upside).

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Main Risk:** Complacency. The market and the provided research reflect a strong consensus. If this consensus is wrong (e.g., the lagged effects of monetary policy are about to hit), spreads could widen very rapidly. The current low spread offers very little compensation for this risk.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A "risk-off" shock (geopolitical, a key earnings miss, or a surprisingly bad economic data point) occurs right before or during the resolution window. This could cause spreads to gap out 75-100 bps, toward the 3.50%-3.75% range. My P90 must account for this possibility.
- **Contrarian View:** The "all-in" yield is so attractive that it creates a powerful and persistent bid for high-yield debt, suppressing volatility and keeping spreads pinned at current lows regardless of minor negative news. This would suggest a much narrower distribution.
- **Adjustment:** I believe the risk of a shock outweighs the technical suppression argument. The asymmetry is the key feature. I will ensure my P80 and P90 reflect a plausible "risk-off" scenario, making the gap between P60-P80 and P80-P90 larger than the gaps at the lower end of the distribution. My percentiles reflect this skew.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 2.60
P20: 2.70
P40: 2.80
P60: 3.05
P80: 3.30
P90: 3.70

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**  
   An appropriate base rate is the recent "tight spread" regime (2021-present, excluding early 2022 volatility), where spreads have ranged from 2.75% to 4.00%, with a median around 3.25%. This is chosen because the forecast horizon is short (~3-4 weeks), and recent market conditions (post-pandemic recovery, soft landing narrative) are the most relevant reference class, reflecting current index composition, sentiment, and low volatility. Long-term averages (e.g., 5.24% mean) include crises and are less applicable for near-term stability. The prior distribution is right-skewed (allowing for widening during shocks), with a median of 3.25%, mean of ~3.40%, and standard deviation of ~0.75% (capturing the observed range with moderate variance).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**  
   The current situation is similar to the base case in persistent tight spreads amid strong corporate fundamentals, low default expectations (1-3%), and a "risk-on" environment, with no major shocks in recent months. It differs in the extremely low starting point (2.76%, near record lows), which introduces asymmetry: limited room for further tightening but higher potential for widening on negative news. Additionally, the forecast period overlaps with Q3 earnings season, adding short-term volatility not always present in the base regime. These differences suggest a downward shift in the central tendency (toward current levels) but increased upper-tail risk due to mean reversion and event sensitivity.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**  
   - Structural index improvement (higher BB-rated bonds, low CCC allocation): Strongly consistent with lower spreads (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring values <3% vs. >4%, as it justifies a lower baseline than historical norms). Pushes forecast down significantly.  
   - Benign default projections (1-3% for 2025) and strong balance sheets: Highly supportive of tight spreads (likelihood ratio ~2.5:1 for <3% vs. higher), reducing risk premia. Large downward push.  
   - Technical demand from elevated all-in yields (~6.42%): Moderately favors stability or tightening (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 for <3%), providing a floor. Moderate downward adjustment.  
   - Extremely low starting point (2.76%) and mean reversion risk: Consistent with higher values on shocks (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 favoring >3% vs. lower), introducing asymmetry. Moderate upward push on tails.  
   - Earnings season timing (Oct 13-24): Adds two-sided volatility (neutral central but ~1.2:1 for extremes), with potential for upside surprises widening spreads. Small upward tail adjustment.  
   Net: Evidence skews toward lower values but with amplified upper-tail likelihoods.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**  
   Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood. Start with prior (median 3.25%, SD 0.75%). Update with strong downward evidence (e.g., structural quality and low defaults): this multiplies likelihoods, shifting the mean down by ~0.4% (to ~3.0%) and compressing variance slightly (SD ~0.65%) due to reinforcing stability. Then incorporate asymmetry (upward tail factors): this stretches the upper tail, increasing skew (e.g., P90 moves up more than P10 moves down). Final posterior: median ~2.90%, mean ~3.05%, with reduced variance but fatter upper tail reflecting event risk.

5. **Red Team Thinking**  
   Potential overconfidence: The short horizon assumes stability, but I'm underweighting black-swan events (e.g., geopolitical flare-up or sudden Fed hawkishness) that could spike spreads to 4-5% rapidly, as seen in past flash widenings. Blind spot: Consensus reports may be overly optimistic, ignoring lagged policy effects or "priced for perfection." Alternative forecast: A more bearish view (median 3.5%, P90 5.0%) if assuming imminent mean reversion, plausible due to historical corrections from lows (e.g., 2007). Rebuttal: Current fundamentals are stronger than past lows, and no catalysts are evident, so this overstates upside; still, I adjust upper percentiles upward slightly for tail risks. No major lower-tail adjustment, as further tightening below 2.5% is unlikely without extraordinary positives.

P10: 2.5
P20: 2.6
P40: 2.8
P60: 3.0
P80: 3.5
P90: 4.0
