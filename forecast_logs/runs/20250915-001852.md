### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical US CPI Changes**: Over the past 20 years, the average annual change in the US CPI has been around 2-3%. However, recent years have seen higher volatility.
- **Post-Election Economic Adjustments**: Historically, new presidential terms can lead to economic policy shifts, with inflation rates fluctuating by 1-2% in the first year.
- **Global Economic Trends**: Global inflation trends can influence US CPI, with typical changes of 0.5-1% due to international factors.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-08-19] Inflation ↑ — Recent data shows inflation rising, impacting consumer prices and economic stability.
- [2025-03-04] Policy Uncertainty ↓ — Trump's address suggested potential policy shifts, creating uncertainty in inflation forecasts.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Monetary Policy**: Large — Interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve can significantly impact inflation.
- **Fiscal Policy**: Moderate — Government spending and tax policies can influence inflationary pressures.
- **Tariffs and Trade Policies**: Moderate — Tariffs can increase costs, affecting inflation.
- **Labor Market Conditions**: Moderate — Tight labor markets can drive wage increases, impacting inflation.
- **Global Economic Conditions**: Small — International economic trends can have a ripple effect on US inflation.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Presidential Influence**: Trump's active role in monetary policy is atypical and could lead to unpredictable inflation outcomes.
- **Tariff Policies**: Current tariff levels are higher than historical norms, potentially increasing inflation.
- **Labor Market Dynamics**: The current labor market is tighter than usual, with potential upward pressure on wages and inflation.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a prior of 50% probability for inflation being lower in November 2025, with an equivalent n of 20 based on historical volatility.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - Inflation ↑ (large) — Recent data suggests rising inflation.
  - Policy Uncertainty ↓ (moderate) — Potential policy shifts create uncertainty.
  - Tariffs ↑ (moderate) — Higher tariffs could increase inflation.
- **Net effect**: The posterior should move slightly down, indicating a lower probability of inflation being lower in November 2025.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Federal Reserve rate cuts.
  - Reduction in tariffs.
  - Decrease in wage growth.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Continued high tariffs.
  - Increased government spending.
  - Rising global commodity prices.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Policy Uncertainty**: Trump's influence on the Fed introduces unpredictability.
- **Data Gaps**: Incomplete data on global economic impacts.
- **Regime Changes**: New policies may not have immediate effects.
- **Definitional Gotchas**: Changes in CPI calculation methods could skew results.

Final Research Summary: Recent data suggests rising inflation, with policy uncertainty and tariffs as key factors. The probability of lower inflation in November 2025 is slightly reduced. Watch for Federal Reserve actions and tariff changes as leading indicators.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The historical average annual change in the US CPI has been around 2-3% over the past 20 years. However, recent years have seen higher volatility, with inflation rates fluctuating more significantly. Given the current context of policy uncertainty and economic conditions, a neutral prior of 50% is reasonable, reflecting the uncertainty and potential for either outcome.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The current situation involves typical post-election economic adjustments and potential policy shifts, which historically have led to fluctuations in inflation rates.
       - Differences: The active role of the president in monetary policy and higher-than-normal tariffs are atypical and could lead to more unpredictable inflation outcomes.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - **Inflation ↑ (large)**: Recent data shows rising inflation, suggesting a higher likelihood of continued inflationary pressures. This decreases the probability of a lower CPI in November 2025.
         - Likelihood ratio: P(E | H) < P(E | ~H), indicating a decrease in probability.
       - **Policy Uncertainty ↓ (moderate)**: Potential policy shifts create uncertainty, which could lead to either higher or lower inflation. This evidence is somewhat neutral but leans towards maintaining current inflation levels.
         - Likelihood ratio: P(E | H) ≈ P(E | ~H), minimal impact.
       - **Tariffs ↑ (moderate)**: Higher tariffs could increase costs, contributing to inflation. This decreases the probability of a lower CPI.
         - Likelihood ratio: P(E | H) < P(E | ~H), indicating a decrease in probability.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds: 1:1 (50% probability)
       - Considering the evidence, particularly the recent rise in inflation and higher tariffs, the likelihood ratios suggest a decrease in the probability of lower inflation.
       - Posterior odds: Adjusting for the evidence, the odds shift slightly towards higher inflation, perhaps to 1:1.5.
       - Posterior probability: (1 / (1 + 1.5)) ≈ 40%
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for policy changes to reduce inflation, such as aggressive Federal Reserve actions or unexpected economic slowdowns.
       - Alternative scenario: A significant economic downturn or effective policy measures could lead to lower inflation, counteracting current trends.
       - Adjustments: Consider a slight increase in the probability to account for these potential mitigating factors.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - After considering the evidence and potential alternative scenarios, the final probability is adjusted to reflect a slightly higher chance of inflation being lower than initially calculated.
       - Final: 45%
