### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical Global Temperature Records**: Since 1880, the global temperature has increased, with recent years frequently setting new records. Base rate for any given year being the warmest is low but increasing.
- **El Niño Years**: Historically, El Niño years tend to be warmer. Base rate for El Niño years being the warmest is higher than average years.
- **Decadal Trends**: Recent decades show a consistent warming trend, with each decade warmer than the last.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-09-18] ↑ — Early 2025 data shows temperatures closely following 2024, indicating potential for record warmth.
- [2025-09-16] ↑ — Reports highlight ongoing temperature increases, stressing the impact on vulnerable populations.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **El Niño Events**: Large impact; typically increase global temperatures.
- **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Moderate to large impact; ongoing emissions contribute to warming.
- **Solar Activity**: Small impact; variations can slightly influence temperatures.
- **Volcanic Activity**: Moderate impact; can cause temporary cooling.
- **Oceanic Heat Content**: Moderate impact; increased heat content can drive surface temperature rises.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the probability of 2025 being the warmest year on record globally according to the ECMWF, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - **Base Rate**: Historically, the probability of any given year being the warmest on record is low. However, recent trends show an increase in global temperatures, with 2023 and 2024 consecutively being the warmest years. Given the strong El Niño and ongoing warming trends, a reasonable base rate for 2025 being the warmest year is higher than average. Let's assume a base rate of 20% for a strong El Niño year, which is higher than the historical average due to recent trends.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - **Similarities**: The current situation is similar to past El Niño years, which tend to be warmer. The ongoing warming trend and recent record years set a high baseline.
       - **Differences**: The strength of the current El Niño and the high baseline temperatures from 2023 and 2024 are notable differences that increase the likelihood of 2025 being the warmest year.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - **Strong El Niño**: The likelihood of 2025 being the warmest year is higher given the strong El Niño (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)). This increases the probability.
       - **Early 2025 Data**: Data showing temperatures closely following 2024 suggests a high likelihood of record warmth (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)). This also increases the probability.
       - **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Continued high emissions support the warming trend (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)). This slightly increases the probability.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - **Prior Odds**: 20% probability translates to odds of 0.25.
       - **Likelihood Ratio**: Considering the strong El Niño and early data, let's assume a likelihood ratio of 3 (indicative of strong evidence).
       - **Posterior Odds**: 0.25 (prior odds) × 3 (likelihood ratio) = 0.75.
       - **Posterior Probability**: 0.75 / (1 + 0.75) = 0.43 or 43%.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - **Overconfidence Check**: The forecast might be overconfident given potential cooling events like volcanic eruptions. However, the strong El Niño and recent trends justify a higher probability.
       - **Alternative Scenarios**: A significant volcanic eruption or unexpected cooling could lower the probability. However, these are less likely given current data.
       - **Adjustment**: Considering potential cooling events, a slight downward adjustment might be prudent.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - After considering all factors, including potential cooling events and uncertainties, the final calibrated probability is adjusted slightly downward to account for these risks.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Moderate likelihood of completion given typical M&A base rates; equivalent n = 50.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↓ DOJ lawsuit (large negative)
  - ↑ Shareholder approval (moderate positive)
  - ↓ Regulatory environment under Biden (large negative)
  - ↑ JetBlue's commitment to defend merger (small positive)
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move down moderately due to strong regulatory headwinds.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Favorable court rulings for JetBlue.
  - Settlement or compromise with DOJ.
  - Positive economic indicators for airlines.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Adverse court decisions.
  - Increased DOJ antitrust actions.
  - Negative public or political sentiment.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Uncertainty in Legal Outcomes**: Court decisions are unpredictable.
- **Data Gaps**: Limited transparency on internal negotiations.
- **Deception Risks**: Potential for strategic misinformation by stakeholders.
- **Regime Changes**: Political shifts could alter regulatory priorities.
- **Definitional Gotchas**: Ambiguities in what constitutes merger completion.

Final Research Summary: The likelihood of JetBlue acquiring Spirit Airlines by 2026 is currently challenged by significant regulatory hurdles, particularly the DOJ's antitrust lawsuit. While shareholder support is a positive factor, the aggressive regulatory environment under the Biden administration suggests a moderate decrease in the probability of merger completion.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the probability of JetBlue announcing that it has acquired Spirit Airlines before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Base Rate**: The base rate for large M&A transactions being canceled is approximately 10% annually. However, given the specific context of airline mergers and the regulatory scrutiny they face, a more tailored base rate is needed.
    - **Adjusted Base Rate**: Considering the historical challenges in airline mergers due to regulatory scrutiny, a more conservative base rate of 60% completion probability is reasonable. This accounts for the higher likelihood of regulatory intervention in this industry.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarities**: The merger is a large M&A transaction, aligning with the base rate context. Shareholder approval is a positive indicator, similar to other successful mergers.
    - **Differences**: The DOJ's aggressive antitrust stance under the Biden administration is a significant deviation from typical cases, increasing the likelihood of regulatory blockage.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **DOJ Lawsuit**: The DOJ's lawsuit to block the merger is a strong negative indicator. Historically, such lawsuits significantly reduce the likelihood of merger completion. Likelihood ratio: 0.3 (P(E | H) = 0.3, P(E | ~H) = 0.7).
    - **Shareholder Approval**: Spirit's shareholder approval is a moderate positive indicator, suggesting internal alignment and support. Likelihood ratio: 1.2 (P(E | H) = 0.6, P(E | ~H) = 0.5).
    - **Regulatory Environment**: The current regulatory environment under the Biden administration is a large negative factor. Likelihood ratio: 0.4 (P(E | H) = 0.4, P(E | ~H) = 0.6).
    - **JetBlue's Commitment**: JetBlue's commitment to defend the merger is a small positive factor. Likelihood ratio: 1.1 (P(E | H) = 0.55, P(E | ~H) = 0.5).
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    - **Prior Odds**: 60% probability translates to odds of 0.6 / 0.4 = 1.5.
    - **Likelihood Ratio**: Combining all evidence, the overall likelihood ratio is approximately 0.3 * 1.2 * 0.4 * 1.1 ≈ 0.1584.
    - **Posterior Odds**: 1.5 * 0.1584 ≈ 0.2376.
    - **Posterior Probability**: 0.2376 / (1 + 0.2376) ≈ 0.192 or 19.2%.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: The forecast accounts for significant regulatory hurdles, but the unpredictability of court decisions remains a risk.
    - **Alternative Scenarios**: A favorable court ruling or settlement with the DOJ could significantly increase the probability. Conversely, further DOJ actions could decrease it.
    - **Adjustment**: Given the aggressive regulatory environment and recent DOJ successes, maintaining a conservative estimate is prudent.
    
    ### 6. Final Forecast
    - **Final Probability**: Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential scenarios, the probability of JetBlue announcing the acquisition of Spirit Airlines before 2026 is approximately 19%.
    
    Final: 19%
