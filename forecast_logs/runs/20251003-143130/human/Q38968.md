### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-WWII German Federal Party Ban Applications:** Since 1949, there have been four applications to ban a political party at the federal level.
    *   **Cases:** Socialist Reich Party (SRP, filed 1951, banned 1952), Communist Party of Germany (KPD, filed 1952, banned 1956), National Democratic Party (NPD, filed 2001, failed 2003), and a second attempt against the NPD (filed 2013, failed 2017).
    *   **Base Rate:** Four applications in ~76 years gives a rough base rate of one application being filed every ~19 years, or ~5% in any given year.
    *   **Limitations:** This class is very small. The political context has changed dramatically, and the AfD's electoral significance is far greater than any of the previous targets at the time of the application, making this a weak prior.

2.  **Major Constitutional Court Challenges by Federal Bodies:** A broader class could be any application filed by the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or Federal Government at the Constitutional Court on a matter of major political sensitivity. This is difficult to quantify but is also a rare event, likely occurring less than once per legislative period, suggesting a low single-digit percentage chance per year.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
Given the question's horizon (Jan 1, 2026) and today's date (Oct 3, 2025), the recency window emphasizes the last 6 months. This period is dominated by the aftermath of the September 2025 federal election.

*   **2025-09-28** Federal election held; AfD achieves a record result, becoming the second-largest party in the Bundestag. (↔/↓) — Increases the perceived threat, but also raises the political cost and risk of banning a party with such a large electoral mandate.
*   **2025-09-15** Leading figures from SPD and CDU state that a ban procedure is not a priority for the election campaign's final weeks. (↓) — Signals that the political will at the leadership level is weak and focused elsewhere, a stance likely to carry over into coalition talks.
*   **2025-07-20** The Bundestag's Interior Committee concludes hearings on the Wanderwitz motion without a recommendation, effectively postponing any decision until after the election. (↓) — Confirms the lack of a pre-election consensus and pushes the timeline for any potential action into the complex post-election period.
*   **2025-06-05** A legal opinion commissioned by a civil society group argues the evidence against the AfD is stronger than it was for the NPD, but highlights the high procedural hurdles. (↔) — Reinforces the core dilemma: the justification may exist, but the political and legal risks of failure remain immense.
*   **2025-04-10** Chancellor Scholz (SPD) expresses skepticism about the timing of a ban application, emphasizing the need for political confrontation over legal action. (↓) — Shows continued high-level reluctance from a key decision-making body (the Federal Government).

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Political Will of a New Governing Coalition (Large):** The primary driver. An application requires a majority in the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or a cabinet decision. With coalition negotiations underway after the September election, consensus on such a high-risk, divisive issue is extremely difficult to achieve.
2.  **Perceived Risk of Failure & "Martyrdom Effect" (Large):** The 2017 NPD ruling set an extremely high bar, requiring proof that a party is not only anti-constitutional but also has a tangible potential to achieve its aims. A failed attempt would be a massive propaganda victory for the AfD, a risk mainstream parties are acutely aware of.
3.  **Urgency from a "Black Swan" Event (Moderate):** A major scandal, revelation of concrete coup plans, or an act of political violence directly linked to senior AfD figures could dramatically shift the political calculus and create overwhelming public pressure to act.
4.  **Procedural Inertia (Moderate):** The legislative and legal process is slow. The Wanderwitz motion has been in committee since January 2025. Even with political will, getting it through committee, onto the floor for a vote, and formally filed before year-end is a tight schedule, especially for a new parliament.
5.  **Influence of State-Level Politics (Small):** Strong calls for a ban from state governments where the AfD is powerful (e.g., Thuringia, Saxony) could pressure the Bundesrat, but this body is unlikely to act without alignment at the federal level.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Electoral Scale:** Unlike the fringe NPD, the AfD is a major political force, now the second-largest party in the Bundestag. Attempting to ban a party with ~20-25% of the vote is unprecedented and raises profound questions about democratic legitimacy that were not present in past cases.
*   **The 2017 NPD Precedent:** The Constitutional Court's 2017 ruling clarified the criteria for a ban, paradoxically making it harder to ban a more successful party. The court may be even more hesitant to disenfranchise millions of voters compared to the few hundred thousand who voted for the NPD.
*   **Public Mobilization:** The scale of public debate and street protests against the AfD (e.g., early 2024) is far larger than anything seen in the NPD cases, creating more political pressure *for* a ban, even if elites remain hesitant.
*   **Nature of the Threat:** The AfD's perceived threat is less about neo-Nazi ideology (like the SRP/NPD) and more about a systematic, "illiberal" challenge to democratic institutions from within parliament, a type of threat the ban mechanism was not originally designed for.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior based on the historical rarity of such filings (e.g., 5-10%), with a low "equivalent n" (e.g., n=10) due to the small and dated reference class.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The post-election context: All political energy is focused on forming a new government, making a divisive, high-risk constitutional gambit a non-starter in the short term.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Procedural stall: The key parliamentary motion has been dormant for over nine months, signaling a durable lack of majority support.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Continued high-level caution: Key leaders have consistently prioritized political debate over a legal ban, a stance unlikely to change during sensitive coalition talks.
    *   (↑ Small) AfD's electoral strength: While making a ban politically riskier (a net negative), the strong election result increases the sense of urgency among the party's staunchest opponents, keeping the issue alive.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points to inaction in the short term. The posterior probability should be revised significantly downwards from an already low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A ban procedure being explicitly mentioned as a priority in a new coalition agreement.
    *   The Bundestag's Interior Committee unexpectedly scheduling a vote on the Wanderwitz motion.
    *   A major new scandal (e.g., verified espionage, concrete plans to subvert the state) involving top AfD leadership.
    *   Coordinated, supportive statements from the leaders of the new coalition parties.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The new coalition agreement is published and makes no mention of a ban procedure.
    *   Marco Wanderwitz or other key proponents announce they are pausing their initiative.
    *   The new Chancellor or Interior Minister publicly rules out filing an application in the near term.
    *   Parliamentary business for the remainder of 2025 focuses entirely on budget and government formation.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Black Swan Event:** The primary uncertainty is a sudden, shocking event (e.g., political violence, a major security revelation) that could override all normal political calculations.
*   **Coalition Dynamics:** Secret negotiations to form the next government could include a surprise agreement on this issue, though it is highly improbable.
*   **Definitional Clarity:** The question resolves on *filing* the application, not its success. A desperate, symbolic filing by a lame-duck government or a minority in parliament is a remote possibility, though the main bodies (Gov't, Bundestag, Bundesrat) act on majorities.
*   **Information Lag:** We are in a fluid post-election period. Public statements may not reflect the reality of private negotiations among party leaders.
*   **Misinterpretation of Rhetoric:** Expect continued strong rhetoric against the AfD; the key is to distinguish this from concrete procedural steps towards filing a ban application.

**Final Research Summary:** The confluence of a very short time horizon and a post-election period focused on government formation makes the filing of an AfD ban application before 2026 extremely unlikely. The immense political risks and high legal

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for filing an application to ban a political party at the federal level in Germany is approximately 5% per year, based on historical data since 1949. This is derived from four applications over 76 years. However, this base rate is weak due to the small sample size and changing political context.
   - Initial prior: 5% probability.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarity: The current situation involves a party classified as "suspected extremist," similar to past cases.
   - Difference: The AfD is a major political force, unlike previous targets, which raises the political cost and complexity of pursuing a ban.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Post-election context**: The focus is on forming a new government, making a ban unlikely in the short term. Likelihood ratio < 1, decreases probability.
   - **Procedural stall**: The Wanderwitz motion has been dormant, indicating lack of support. Likelihood ratio < 1, decreases probability.
   - **High-level caution**: Leaders prioritize political debate over legal action. Likelihood ratio < 1, decreases probability.
   - **AfD's electoral strength**: Increases urgency but also risk, net effect is a small increase in probability. Likelihood ratio slightly > 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 5% / 95% = 0.0526
   - Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratios for the major pieces of evidence are less than 1, indicating a decrease in probability.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (net effect < 1)
   - Posterior probability = (Posterior odds) / (1 + Posterior odds)
   - Given the overwhelming evidence against filing, the posterior probability is significantly lower than the prior.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The analysis might underestimate the impact of a sudden political shift or black swan event.
   - Alternative scenario: A major scandal or security threat could force action, but this remains unlikely.
   - Adjustments: Consider a small increase for unforeseen events, but maintain a low probability due to current evidence.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - The final probability reflects the low base rate, the significant political and procedural barriers, and the current political focus on government formation.
   - Final: 3%

# Will an application to ban AfD be filed at the Federal Constitutional Court before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on historical precedent of party ban applications in Germany.

Looking at post-WWII Germany, there have been four applications to ban political parties at the federal level:
- Socialist Reich Party (SRP): Filed 1951, banned 1952
- Communist Party of Germany (KPD): Filed 1952, banned 1956
- National Democratic Party (NPD): Filed 2001, failed 2003
- NPD again: Filed 2013, failed 2017

This gives us 4 applications in approximately 76 years, or roughly one application every 19 years. This translates to about a 5% chance in any given year. However, this reference class is very small and the political context has changed significantly.

Given that we're looking at a specific timeframe (now until January 1, 2026, which is about 3 months), the base rate would be even lower - approximately 1.25% (5% × 3/12).

However, I should adjust this slightly upward because there's already been explicit discussion about banning the AfD, with 37 lawmakers announcing they would seek such a ban. This puts the situation beyond the typical baseline.

**Initial prior: 10%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The AfD, like previous banned/attempted ban parties, is viewed by some as extremist and potentially threatening to the constitutional order
- There is a formal mechanism for such bans that remains unchanged
- There are political actors actively advocating for a ban

**Key differences:**
- Unlike previous targets (especially NPD), the AfD is now the second-largest party in the Bundestag with significant electoral support
- The 2017 NPD ruling set a very high bar for party bans, requiring not just anti-constitutional positions but also demonstrable potential to achieve those aims
- The post-election context (September 2025) means political focus is on government formation, not controversial constitutional procedures
- Banning a party with 20-25% of the vote raises democratic legitimacy questions not present in previous cases

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood compared to historical cases.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: The Wanderwitz motion has stalled in committee**
- P(E|H): If a ban application were to be filed soon, we would expect the motion to be advancing, not stalled = 0.2
- P(E|~H): If no ban application will be filed, a stalled motion is exactly what we'd expect = 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22 (strong evidence against filing)

**Evidence 2: Post-election context and coalition formation**
- P(E|H): If a ban were to be filed, we'd expect it to be a priority in coalition talks = 0.3
- P(E|~H): If no ban will be filed, we'd expect coalition talks to focus elsewhere = 0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.95 = 0.32 (strong evidence against filing)

**Evidence 3: Statements from key political leaders expressing skepticism**
- P(E|H): If a ban were imminent, we'd expect supportive statements = 0.25
- P(E|~H): If no ban will be filed, skeptical statements are expected = 0.85
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25/0.85 = 0.29 (strong evidence against filing)

**Evidence 4: AfD's strong electoral performance**
- P(E|H): If a ban were to be filed, the AfD's strength might increase urgency = 0.6
- P(E|~H): If no ban will be filed, the AfD's strength makes a ban politically riskier = 0.7
- Likelihood ratio: 0.6/0.7 = 0.86 (slight evidence against filing)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 10%/90% = 0.11

First update (stalled motion):
Posterior odds = 0.11 × 0.22 = 0.024
Posterior probability = 0.024/(1+0.024) = 2.3%

Second update (post-election context):
Posterior odds = 0.024 × 0.32 = 0.0077
Posterior probability = 0.0077/(1+0.0077) = 0.76%

Third update (skeptical statements):
Posterior odds = 0.0077 × 0.29 = 0.0022
Posterior probability = 0.0022/(1+0.0022) = 0.22%

Fourth update (AfD's electoral strength):
Posterior odds = 0.0022 × 0.86 = 0.0019
Posterior probability = 0.0019/(1+0.0019) = 0.19%

This seems excessively low. Let me reconsider some of the likelihood ratios which may have been too extreme. The combined effect of all evidence shouldn't reduce the probability quite this dramatically.

Adjusting for potential overconfidence, and considering that the Manifold market is at 8%, I should recalibrate. The evidence is strongly negative, but not to this extreme degree.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis may be overlooking several important factors:

1. **Black Swan Events**: A major scandal or revelation about the AfD could dramatically change the calculus. For example, concrete evidence of a planned coup or foreign influence operation could create overwhelming pressure to act.

2. **Symbolic Filing**: The question only requires an application to be filed, not for it to succeed. A minority group in parliament might file a symbolic application even without majority support.

3. **Political Calculation**: If the new government believes the AfD poses an existential threat to democracy, they might decide the risks of inaction outweigh the risks of a failed ban attempt.

4. **Hidden Information**: Coalition negotiations are private, and public statements may not reflect actual intentions.

5. **Procedural Acceleration**: The Interior Committee could unexpectedly accelerate its work on the Wanderwitz motion.

The Manifold market at 8% suggests other forecasters see a higher probability than my analysis indicates. This could reflect information I'm missing or different weighting of the evidence.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all factors:
- The historical rarity of party ban applications
- The extremely high legal bar established in the 2017 NPD ruling
- The post-election focus on government formation
- The political risks of attempting to ban a party with significant electoral support
- The procedural hurdles and limited time remaining in 2025
- The possibility of unexpected events or hidden political calculations

I believe the probability is low but not negligible. The evidence strongly suggests no application will be filed in the next three months, but I should avoid excessive confidence given the potential for unexpected developments.

Final: 5%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event is an application to ban a political party at the federal level in Germany. The appropriate reference class is the history of such applications in the Federal Republic of Germany (since 1949).

*   **Reference Class Data:** There have been four such applications: against the Socialist Reich Party (SRP, 1951), the Communist Party of Germany (KPD, 1952), and the National Democratic Party (NPD, 2001 and 2013).
*   **Calculation:** Four applications over approximately 76 years yields a base rate of one application every 19 years, or an annual probability of roughly 5.3%.
*   **Initial Prior:** Given this is a rare event, a low single-digit annual probability is a good starting point. I will set the prior probability P(H) at **5%** for any given year. In prior odds, this is 1:19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation with the AfD has crucial differences from the historical cases.

*   **Similarities:** The AfD is viewed by opponents as an anti-constitutional threat to the democratic order, which is the fundamental justification for a ban application, similar to the SRP, KPD, and NPD.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Electoral Significance:** The AfD is a major political party, hypothetically the second-largest in the Bundestag after the September 2025 election. Previous targets were fringe parties with minimal electoral support. Attempting to ban a party representing millions of voters raises the political stakes and democratic legitimacy concerns immensely, making decision-makers far more cautious.
    2.  **Legal Precedent:** The Federal Constitutional Court's 2017 ruling on the NPD set an extremely high bar for a ban, requiring not just anti-constitutional goals but also a tangible capacity to achieve them. The risk of a failed attempt, which would be a huge propaganda victory for the AfD, acts as a powerful deterrent.

These differences, particularly the AfD's size, make an application significantly *less* likely than the historical base rate would suggest.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The question resolves at the end of 2025, leaving less than three months from the current date (October 3, 2025). The recent evidence is critical.

*   **Evidence 1: Post-Election Political Focus.** The September 2025 federal election has just occurred. The entire political system is now consumed with forming a new governing coalition. This complex process typically takes months and requires compromise, making it an exceptionally poor time to launch a divisive, high-risk constitutional procedure.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** The observation of post-election coalition talks is highly probable if no ban is filed (P(E|~H) ≈ 1) but very improbable if a ban were imminent (P(E|H) << 1). This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Lack of Procedural Momentum.** The primary parliamentary initiative for a ban (the Wanderwitz motion) has been stalled in committee for over nine months and was not advanced before the election.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This lack of momentum is expected if no application is planned (P(E|~H) is high) but very unlikely if an application were to be filed shortly (P(E|H) is low). This also strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Cautious Stances of Key Leaders.** Senior figures, including Chancellor Scholz, have consistently expressed skepticism about a ban, favoring political confrontation. This stance is unlikely to change during sensitive coalition negotiations.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** These public statements are much more likely if no application is being prepared (P(E|~H) is high) than if one were secretly in the works (P(E|H) is low). This further decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior Odds:** 1:19 (equivalent to 5% probability).
*   **Update:** The evidence is strong, consistent, and points overwhelmingly in one direction. The political calendar is the most powerful factor; with less than three months left in the year, the window for action is effectively closed by the all-consuming process of government formation. A caretaker government would not take such a step, and a new government will not be in place and ready to act before 2026.
*   **Conceptual Calculation:** The combined likelihood ratio of the evidence is very small (<< 1). Applying this to the already low prior odds results in a very low posterior. For instance, if we start with a time-adjusted prior for the 3-month period of ~1.3% and judge that the current political context makes a filing at least 10 times less likely than in a normal period, the probability drops to the ~0.1% range. However, this mechanical approach may understate tail risks.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The primary reason this forecast is not 0% is the possibility of a "black swan" event. A major security crisis, such as a revealed coup plot or a significant act of political violence directly linked to the AfD's senior leadership, could override all normal political calculations. In such a crisis, a caretaker government or an emergency cross-party consensus in the new Bundestag might be compelled to file an application immediately.
*   **Plausibility:** The probability of such a specific, high-impact event occurring and triggering a formal application within the next 12 weeks is extremely low, but it is not zero. This tail risk is the main source of uncertainty.
*   **Rebuttal to Higher Forecasts:** A forecast like the 8% on Manifold seems to neglect the paralyzing effect of the post-election negotiations. The procedural and political barriers in the short term are immense. An 8% probability implies that this event is not particularly shocking, whereas the current context suggests it would be.
*   **Adjustment:** The probability derived from the normal course of politics is near-zero. The final forecast must therefore almost entirely reflect the small probability of a high-impact, system-shocking event. I assess this risk to be in the low single digits.

### Final Forecast
The combination of a very short time horizon and a post-election period dedicated to forming a new government makes the filing of an AfD ban application before 2026 extremely unlikely. The normal political process for such an action is effectively blocked for the remainder of the year. The only plausible path to a "Yes" resolution is a low-probability, high-impact "black swan" event that forces the hand of political leaders. My forecast is dominated by the small chance of this tail risk materializing.

Final: 3%
