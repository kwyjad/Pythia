### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the historical base rate for unexpected outages on major international sub-sea gas pipelines, especially those in geopolitically sensitive areas?
    *   What are the specific, current threats to the TurkStream and Blue Stream pipelines? This includes kinetic/military risks, technical vulnerabilities, and political/commercial pressures.
    *   What is the status of the gas contract negotiations between Russia (Gazprom) and Turkey (BOTAŞ) for the contracts expiring at the end of 2025?
    *   What are the strategic interests and incentives of the key actors: Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, and the EU?
    *   How should the term "unexpectedly" be interpreted in the context of the resolution criteria, particularly regarding contract disputes?

2.  **Search Queries:**
    *   `major subsea gas pipeline failure rate`
    *   `history of gas pipeline outages geopolitics`
    *   `Nord Stream pipeline sabotage investigation 2025`
    *   `Ukraine attacks on Russian energy infrastructure Black Sea`
    *   `TurkStream pipeline security incidents drone attacks`
    *   `Blue Stream pipeline maintenance history unscheduled outages`
    *   `Gazprom BOTAŞ gas contract negotiations 2025 status`
    *   `Turkey Russia energy relations 2025`
    *   `Turkey LNG import deals 2025`
    *   `EU policy Russian gas TurkStream 2025`

3.  **Information Synthesis:**
    *   The primary risks are twofold: (1) deliberate military action by Ukraine, which has motive and growing capability, and (2) an escalation of commercial disputes between Russia and Turkey into a pre-emptive supply cut before the contract's official end date.
    *   Historical base rates for such pipelines are very low, but the Nord Stream incident in 2022 and the ongoing war fundamentally change the context, making historical data less reliable.
    *   Both Russia and Turkey have strong short-term incentives to maintain gas flow: Russia for revenue and political leverage, Turkey for domestic energy needs and its ambition as a regional gas hub.
    *   Turkey's recent LNG deals provide it with leverage in negotiations but do not replace the volume from Russia in the short term, suggesting a deal is still the most likely outcome, but the path there could be rocky.
    *   The term "unexpectedly" is crucial. A shutdown on January 1, 2026, due to non-renewal is *expected*. A shutdown on December 20, 2025, because talks have collapsed would be *unexpected*. The risk is concentrated in events that could happen *before* the year's end.

4.  **Drafting the Brief:**
    *   Structure the synthesized information into the required format, ensuring each section directly addresses the needs of a statistician updating a prior. Focus on clarity, conciseness, and the causal drivers behind potential outcomes.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Major International Subsea Gas Pipelines:** This class includes dozens of pipelines globally. Historically, unexpected, prolonged outages are extremely rare. The annual failure rate due to technical issues or third-party interference (e.g., anchor drag) is well below 1%. However, this class is too broad as it includes pipelines in stable regions.
*   **Pipelines in Geopolitically Contested Regions:** This is a more relevant class (e.g., pipelines in the Mediterranean, South China Sea, Baltic Sea). The base rate here is higher. The 2022 Nord Stream pipeline explosions provide a critical, recent data point. If we consider that event within a reference class of ~10-15 similar high-stakes pipelines over the last decade, it suggests a ballpark base rate for a major sabotage event in the range of **1-5% annually**.
*   **Limitations:** The current situation is arguably *sui generis*. TurkStream is the last major pipeline carrying Russian gas to the EU, and it is proximate to an active, high-intensity war where energy infrastructure is a declared target. This uniqueness suggests the true probability may be higher than historical base rates would imply.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-24** Turkey signs 20-year LNG deals with Mercuria and Woodside. — **↓** — Reduces Turkey's long-term dependency on Russia, strengthening its negotiating position and making a mutually agreeable contract renewal more likely (reducing the risk of a pre-expiry dispute).
*   **2025-08-01** Analysis highlights EU's Russian gas phase-out puts TurkStream at a crossroads. — **↑** — Reduces the long-term strategic value of the pipeline for Russia, potentially making them more willing to use short-term supply disruptions as a bargaining chip with remaining customers.
*   **2025-04-01** TurkStream's European branch utilization drops from 98% to 80%. — **↔** — Likely reflects fluctuating European demand or spot market dynamics rather than a direct threat. Low relevance to an *unexpected* cessation.
*   **2025-03-18** Russia claims to have thwarted a Ukrainian drone attack on TurkStream infrastructure. — **↑↑** — The most direct evidence of a persistent, active military threat to the pipeline's physical integrity. This is a recurring claim, indicating a consistent risk.
*   **2025-02-12** Russian gas supplies via TurkStream hit an all-time high. — **↓** — Demonstrates the pipeline's critical operational importance to both Russia (for revenue) and its customers (for supply) after the halt of Ukrainian transit.
*   **2025-01-01** Ukraine halts the transit of Russian gas to Europe. — **↑** — Makes TurkStream the sole pipeline route for Russian gas to Europe, dramatically increasing its strategic value and making it a more prominent target for Ukraine.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Kinetic Attack by Ukraine (Large):** Ukraine has a clear strategic motive to disrupt Russia's revenue and its last physical energy link to Europe. It has demonstrated increasing capability with long-range drones and uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) in the Black Sea. This is the most significant driver for a "Yes" resolution.
*   **Contract Dispute Escalation (Moderate):** With Blue Stream and TurkStream contracts expiring at year-end, negotiations are critical. A breakdown could lead Russia to halt supply pre-emptively to exert pressure, or Turkey to halt offtake. This would be an "unexpected" cessation before Jan 1, 2026.
*   **Russian Sabotage / False Flag (Small):** Russia could stage an attack on its own pipeline to blame Ukraine, potentially to justify escalation or declare force majeure on supply contracts without penalty. This is a high-impact but lower probability scenario.
*   **Unscheduled Major Technical Failure (Small):** While modern and well-maintained (e.g., Blue Stream's 2023 maintenance), all complex subsea infrastructure carries a risk of unexpected critical failure. The seismic activity in the region is a non-zero, though very low, probability factor.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Proximity to Active War:** Unlike most major pipelines, TurkStream and Blue Stream operate in or near the Black Sea, a contested maritime zone in an ongoing war where energy infrastructure is a primary target.
*   **Last-Route-Standing Status:** TurkStream is the last remaining pipeline artery for Russian gas to the EU. This concentrates both its strategic importance for Russia and its value as a target for Ukraine, a level of criticality not seen in the Nord Stream case before its demise.
*   **Pivotal Role of Turkey:** Turkey is not a passive transit country; it's a major consumer, a NATO member, and a geopolitical actor attempting to balance relations with both Russia and the West. Its actions and leverage in negotiations are a unique and complex variable.
*   **Contract Cliff:** The simultaneous expiration of major contracts at the end of 2025 creates a focal point for leverage and potential conflict, unlike a stable, mid-contract operational period.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior from the "Pipelines in Geopolitically Contested Regions" reference class, perhaps around **4%**, with a low equivalent n (e.g., n=25) to reflect high uncertainty and the impact of the Nord Stream precedent.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑↑ (Large):** Repeated and credible reports of Ukrainian attempts to attack the pipeline. This is the strongest piece of evidence pushing the probability up.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The "contract cliff" at year-end creates a period of heightened risk for a dispute-related shutdown before the deadline.
    *   **↑ (Small):** The EU's phase-out policy slightly increases the chance of Russia using the pipeline as a short-term political weapon rather than protecting it as a long-term asset.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** Strong mutual short-term economic dependence. Russia needs the revenue, and Turkey needs the gas for the winter, creating a powerful incentive to avoid disruption.
    *   **↓ (Small):** Turkey's new LNG deals provide a safety valve and negotiating leverage, potentially leading to a more stable, less desperate negotiation process.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence for an acute, specific threat (kinetic attack) is very strong and recent. This should significantly overwhelm the general incentives for stability. The posterior should move **substantially upward** from the initial prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public statements from Gazprom or BOTAŞ indicating a stalemate or "difficult" negotiations.
    *   Reports of increased Russian naval patrols along the pipeline routes in the Black Sea.
    *   Any successful Ukrainian long-range strike on other major Russian infrastructure (e.g., Kerch Bridge, Novorossiysk port).
    *   Unusual, unscheduled changes in gas flow nominations through the pipelines.
    *   Sharp escalatory rhetoric from Russia regarding the protection of its energy assets.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A joint statement from Russia and Turkey announcing a new long-term gas supply agreement.
    *   High-level diplomatic meetings between Erdoğan and Putin that are publicly declared "constructive."
    *   A significant de-escalation of hostilities in the Black Sea region.
    *   Credible reports of a ceasefire or peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Defining "Unexpectedly":** The resolution hinges on this word. A shutdown on Dec 31, 2025, after a public announcement of failed talks might not be deemed "unexpected." A sudden halt in mid-December would be. This ambiguity is a major pitfall.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Reports of thwarted attacks come almost exclusively from Russia and are difficult to verify independently. Ukraine will not publicize its operational plans. We are operating in a low-information environment.
*   **Scheduled vs. Unscheduled Maintenance:** A planned maintenance shutdown (like in May 2023) does not count. However, a party could disguise a politically motivated shutdown as "emergency maintenance," creating a gray area for resolution.
*   **Conflating Pipelines:** The question resolves "Yes" if *either* pipeline ceases transport. TurkStream faces a much higher kinetic risk due to its path and strategic importance to the EU. Blue Stream's primary risk is commercial/technical. They should not be viewed as having identical risk profiles.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability of an unexpected cessation in 2025 is significantly elevated above historical norms. The primary driver is the credible and persistent threat of a Ukrainian military strike on the TurkStream pipeline, with a secondary, smaller risk of a pre-expiry shutdown stemming from a breakdown in contract negotiations.

To forecast the probability of either the TurkStream or Blue Stream pipeline unexpectedly ceasing to transport gas at any point in 2025, we will follow a Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** For pipelines in geopolitically contested regions, the historical base rate for unexpected outages is estimated to be around 1-5% annually. Given the unique geopolitical tensions and recent events, we will start with a prior probability of 4%.
- **Rationale:** This base rate reflects the increased risk due to geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Black Sea region, and the precedent set by the Nord Stream incident.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Both pipelines are in a geopolitically sensitive area, similar to other pipelines in contested regions.
- **Differences:** The current situation is unique due to the active conflict involving Ukraine, the strategic importance of TurkStream as the last major route for Russian gas to Europe, and the impending expiration of major contracts.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Ukrainian Threats:** Repeated reports of Ukrainian attempts to attack the TurkStream pipeline significantly increase the likelihood of an unexpected cessation. Likelihood ratio > 1.
- **Contract Expiration:** The expiration of contracts at the end of 2025 increases the risk of a pre-expiry shutdown due to negotiation breakdowns. Likelihood ratio > 1.
- **Economic Dependencies:** The mutual economic dependence of Russia and Turkey on the pipelines decreases the likelihood of an unexpected cessation. Likelihood ratio < 1.
- **LNG Deals:** Turkey's new LNG deals slightly reduce the risk by providing alternative energy sources. Likelihood ratio < 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 4% translates to odds of 0.04 / 0.96 = 0.0417.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the strong evidence of Ukrainian threats and moderate evidence of contract risks, we adjust the likelihood ratio to approximately 2.0.
- **Posterior Odds:** 0.0417 * 2.0 = 0.0834.
- **Posterior Probability:** 0.0834 / (1 + 0.0834) ≈ 7.7%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast considers both kinetic and contractual risks, but the uncertainty in geopolitical developments remains high.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A successful diplomatic resolution or a significant de-escalation in the Black Sea could lower the risk.
- **Rebuttals:** The persistent threat of Ukrainian attacks and the strategic importance of the pipelines justify the increased probability.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the evidence and potential scenarios, the probability of an unexpected cessation is adjusted to reflect the heightened risk environment.

Final: 8%

# Will either the TurkStream or Blue Stream pipeline unexpectedly cease transporting gas at any point in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate reference class for unexpected gas pipeline cessations in geopolitically sensitive areas.

The research report identifies two relevant reference classes:
- Major International Subsea Gas Pipelines: Annual failure rate below 1% (too broad)
- Pipelines in Geopolitically Contested Regions: 1-5% annual rate (more relevant)

Given the Nord Stream pipeline explosions in 2022 and considering a reference class of 10-15 similar high-stakes pipelines over the last decade, a reasonable base rate is around 4% annually.

However, this situation has unique characteristics that make it different from the typical case:
- TurkStream is now the last major pipeline carrying Russian gas to the EU
- The pipelines are proximate to an active war zone
- Energy infrastructure is a declared target in the conflict
- Contract negotiations are at a critical juncture with expiration at year-end

Given these factors, I'll start with a prior of 4%, but with low confidence (equivalent n=25) to reflect the high uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- These are major international gas pipelines with geopolitical significance
- They involve Russia as a key actor, similar to Nord Stream
- They operate in contested maritime zones
- They have strategic importance for multiple nations

**Key differences:**
- TurkStream is now the sole pipeline route for Russian gas to Europe after Ukraine halted transit
- There are documented claims of attempted attacks specifically on these pipelines
- The Blue Stream contract is set to expire at the end of 2025, creating a negotiation pressure point
- Turkey plays a unique dual role as both transit country and major consumer
- The war in Ukraine has escalated with increased targeting of energy infrastructure

These differences significantly increase the risk profile compared to the base case.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

Let me evaluate the key pieces of evidence:

**Evidence increasing probability:**

1. **Repeated Ukrainian attack attempts on TurkStream (March 2025)**
   - P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the pipeline will cease, we would expect to see attack attempts
   - P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Even if the pipeline continues operating, we might see unsuccessful attempts
   - Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
   - This is strong evidence increasing the probability

2. **Ukraine halting transit of Russian gas (Jan 2025)**
   - P(E|H): High (~0.8) - This increases TurkStream's strategic value as a target
   - P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - This would happen regardless of future pipeline status
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.14
   - Slight increase in probability

3. **Contract cliff at year-end for Blue Stream**
   - P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Contract disputes often precede supply disruptions
   - P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Many contracts get renegotiated without disruption
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.6
   - Moderate increase in probability

**Evidence decreasing probability:**

1. **Record-high gas supplies via TurkStream (Feb 2025)**
   - P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - If disruption is imminent, we'd expect reduced flows
   - P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Continued operation would show high utilization
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
   - Significant decrease in probability

2. **Turkey's new LNG deals (Sept 2025)**
   - P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Could be preparation for disruption or negotiation leverage
   - P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.6) - Normal diversification regardless of pipeline status
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.83
   - Slight decrease in probability

3. **Mutual economic dependence**
   - P(E|H): Moderate (~0.4) - Economic incentives can be overridden by geopolitics
   - P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Economic incentives typically maintain energy flows
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.5
   - Moderate decrease in probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior of 4% (odds of 1:24), let me update based on the strongest evidence:

1. **Update on Ukrainian attack attempts:**
   - Prior odds: 0.04/(1-0.04) = 0.042
   - Likelihood ratio: 3.0
   - Posterior odds: 0.042 × 3.0 = 0.126
   - Posterior probability: 0.126/(1+0.126) = 11.2%

2. **Update on record-high gas supplies:**
   - Prior odds (from previous update): 0.112/(1-0.112) = 0.126
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.25
   - Posterior odds: 0.126 × 0.25 = 0.0315
   - Posterior probability: 0.0315/(1+0.0315) = 3.1%

3. **Update on contract cliff:**
   - Prior odds (from previous update): 0.031/(1-0.031) = 0.032
   - Likelihood ratio: 1.6
   - Posterior odds: 0.032 × 1.6 = 0.0512
   - Posterior probability: 0.0512/(1+0.0512) = 4.9%

4. **Update on mutual economic dependence:**
   - Prior odds (from previous update): 0.049/(1-0.049) = 0.0515
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.5
   - Posterior odds: 0.0515 × 0.5 = 0.02575
   - Posterior probability: 0.02575/(1+0.02575) = 2.5%

After these updates, we have a posterior probability of approximately 2.5%. However, this seems too low given the unique circumstances and the remaining time in 2025 (about 3 months).

Let me reconsider the evidence holistically:

- The Ukrainian attack attempts are recent, credible, and directly target these pipelines
- TurkStream is now the sole pipeline route for Russian gas to Europe
- The contract expiration creates a period of heightened risk
- There are only 3 months left in 2025, reducing the exposure period

Given these factors, I believe the probability should be higher than 2.5%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Ukraine's capability and determination to strike Russian energy infrastructure
- The research report mentions "repeated" attack attempts, suggesting persistent targeting
- With only 3 months left in 2025, I need to consider the conditional probability given the time remaining
- The definition of "unexpectedly" is crucial - a shutdown due to failed negotiations might still count

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Russia could stage a false flag operation on its own pipeline to blame Ukraine
- Technical failures are possible, especially if maintenance has been compromised by sanctions
- Turkey could use the threat of shutdown as leverage in negotiations

**Adjustments needed:**
- Given the repeated attack attempts and Ukraine's demonstrated capabilities in the Black Sea, the risk of a successful attack is higher than my calculation suggests
- The contract negotiations for Blue Stream create additional risk as they approach the deadline
- The remaining time period (3 months) reduces the overall probability compared to a full year

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all factors:
- Base rate for similar pipelines: ~4% annually
- Strong evidence of specific targeting by Ukraine
- Critical strategic importance of TurkStream as the last pipeline to Europe
- Contract expiration creating negotiation pressure
- Only 3 months remaining in 2025 (reducing the time window by 75%)

The annual rate would likely be around 12-15% given the evidence, but with only 3 months remaining, I need to adjust downward.

Final: 8%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate reference class is "major subsea gas pipelines in geopolitically contested regions." Historically, unexpected outages on such pipelines are rare. However, the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline sabotage provides a crucial recent data point, fundamentally altering the risk landscape. Based on that event within a class of roughly 10-15 high-stakes pipelines over the last decade, a base rate for a major unexpected annual disruption can be estimated in the low single digits.

I will select a prior annual probability of **4%**. This acknowledges the historical rarity while incorporating the precedent set by Nord Stream. This translates to prior odds of 4/96, or 1/24. This prior is held with low confidence, as the current situation has unique features that demand significant updates based on specific evidence.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is significantly more perilous than the general reference case for several reasons:
*   **Proximity to Active War:** The pipelines, particularly TurkStream, are in the Black Sea, an active and contested maritime warzone. This is a stark difference from most other pipelines, including Nord Stream before its destruction.
*   **"Last Route Standing" Status:** With Ukraine halting gas transit, TurkStream is now the sole pipeline carrying Russian gas to the EU. This concentrates its strategic importance, making it a uniquely valuable target for Ukraine and a critical point of leverage for Russia.
*   **Contract Cliff:** Major supply contracts for both pipelines expire at the end of 2025. This creates a specific, high-stakes deadline that introduces significant risk of a commercial dispute escalating into a pre-emptive supply cut.

These factors strongly suggest that the final probability will be substantially higher than the 4% base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Instead of updating a single prior, it is clearer to disaggregate the problem into the distinct causal mechanisms that could lead to an unexpected cessation. The question resolves "Yes" if *either* pipeline stops for *any* unexpected reason. The primary risks are kinetic attack and commercial dispute.

1.  **Kinetic Attack Risk (Primarily on TurkStream):**
    *   **Evidence:** Russia has repeatedly claimed to have thwarted Ukrainian drone and uncrewed surface vessel (USV) attacks on TurkStream infrastructure. Ukraine has a clear strategic motive (disrupting Russian revenue and its last energy link to Europe) and has demonstrated growing long-range strike capabilities in the Black Sea.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This represents the most acute and probable threat. While Russia is heavily defending the asset, Ukraine's persistence and innovation suggest a non-trivial chance of success over the remaining three months of 2025. A successful strike would be a high-impact, unexpected event. I estimate the probability of a kinetically-induced shutdown in Q4 2025 to be **10%**.

2.  **Commercial Dispute Risk (Affecting Both Pipelines):**
    *   **Evidence:** Contracts for both pipelines expire at the end of 2025. Negotiations are ongoing. Russia has a history of using gas supplies as a political weapon. Conversely, both Russia (for revenue) and Turkey/Europe (for supply) have strong mutual economic incentives to reach a deal and maintain flow, especially heading into winter. Turkey's recent LNG deals strengthen its negotiating position, which could lead to a smoother deal but could also embolden it to push harder, risking a breakdown.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** The risk is that negotiations collapse and one party pre-emptively halts supply *before* the January 1, 2026 deadline. While a deal remains the most likely outcome, the potential for miscalculation or brinkmanship is significant. I estimate the probability of an unexpected shutdown due to a commercial dispute in Q4 2025 to be **6%**.

3.  **Other Risks (Technical Failure, False Flag, etc.):**
    *   **Evidence:** This category includes major, unscheduled technical failures or a Russian-staged false flag event. While modern pipelines are reliable, they are not immune to failure. A false flag attack is a low-probability but high-impact possibility.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** These risks are real but substantially lower than the primary drivers. I assign a combined probability of **1%** to this category for Q4 2025.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
To find the total probability of an unexpected cessation from *any* of these causes, we combine the probabilities of the individual risks. Since these events are not mutually exclusive (e.g., a commercial dispute could be happening at the same time Ukraine is planning an attack), the formula is:
P(Total) = 1 - [ (1 - P(Kinetic)) × (1 - P(Commercial)) × (1 - P(Other)) ]

*   P(Total) = 1 - [ (1 - 0.10) × (1 - 0.06) × (1 - 0.01) ]
*   P(Total) = 1 - [ 0.90 × 0.94 × 0.99 ]
*   P(Total) = 1 - [ 0.83754 ]
*   P(Total) = 0.16246

This calculation results in a posterior probability of approximately **16%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be too high if I am underestimating Russia's defensive capabilities or Ukraine's reluctance to alienate Turkey, a key diplomatic and trade partner. The powerful mutual economic incentives for continued flow are the strongest argument for a "No" resolution. A forecaster focused on this could plausibly arrive at a sub-10% probability.

Conversely, my forecast could be too low. I might be underestimating Russia's willingness to absorb economic losses to create political chaos in Europe during the winter, a tactic it has used before. If negotiations with Turkey turn sour, Putin could decide the political value of a shutdown outweighs the revenue. This line of reasoning could support a probability of 20% or higher.

My final forecast of 16% attempts to balance these competing factors. It acknowledges that continued operation is the most likely outcome but reflects that the combined, specific threats create a very substantial risk of failure (roughly a 1-in-6 chance) before the year is out.

### 6. Final Forecast
The analysis, which starts from a conservative base rate and updates based on the severe and specific risks posed by the ongoing war and the contract cliff, leads to a significantly elevated probability. The disaggregation of risks into kinetic, commercial, and other factors provides a structured way to combine these threats.

Final: 16%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
An appropriate base rate for unexpected cessations of major subsea gas pipelines in geopolitically contested regions is drawn from historical data on similar infrastructure, such as pipelines in the Baltic Sea (e.g., Nord Stream), Mediterranean, or Black Sea areas. Over the last decade, there have been roughly 10-15 such high-stakes pipelines, with only a few major unexpected outages (notably the 2022 Nord Stream sabotage). This suggests an annual base rate of around 1-5% for a significant unexpected cessation due to sabotage, conflict, or disputes. I choose 4% as the prior probability P(H), as it balances the rarity of events in stable periods with the elevated risk in contested zones, informed by the research report's reference class. This equates to prior odds of about 1:24 (4% probability implies odds of 4/96 = 1:24).

This base rate is selected because it uses a relevant reference class that accounts for geopolitical tensions, rather than all global pipelines (which have <1% annual failure rates, mostly technical). However, it's conservative given the uniqueness of the Russia-Ukraine war context, where energy infrastructure is explicitly targeted.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case of pipelines in contested regions (e.g., Nord Stream pre-2022) in that both involve subsea infrastructure vulnerable to sabotage in areas of geopolitical friction, with low technical failure rates but high strategic value. Similarities include proximity to conflict zones, reliance on naval protection, and economic incentives for continuity (e.g., revenue for exporters like Russia).

Differences are significant and increase the risk: TurkStream is now the sole remaining route for Russian gas to Europe post-Ukraine transit halt, making it a uniquely high-value target for Ukraine—unlike Nord Stream, which shared transit routes. Blue Stream faces a "contract cliff" at year-end 2025, introducing negotiation risks not present in mid-contract base cases. The ongoing high-intensity war in the Black Sea (with demonstrated Ukrainian drone/USV capabilities) elevates kinetic threats beyond historical norms. These differences matter because they concentrate risks in the remaining months of 2025, particularly Q4, due to escalating military actions and contract deadlines, warranting an upward adjustment from the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Key pieces of evidence from the background and research report:

- **Repeated Ukrainian attack attempts on TurkStream (e.g., March 2025 drone interception claims):** P(E | H) is high (~80%), as a successful or attempted attack would likely precede or cause cessation. P(E | ~H) is lower (~20%), as false claims might occur but are less likely without real threats. Likelihood ratio: ~4 (80%/20%). This strongly increases the probability.
  
- **Contract expiration and negotiation risks (Blue Stream/TurkStream deals end 2025):** P(E | H) ~70%, as disputes could lead to preemptive halts. P(E | ~H) ~40%, as tensions exist even without cessation. Likelihood ratio: ~1.75 (70%/40%). This moderately increases the probability.

- **High mutual economic dependence (e.g., record flows in Feb 2025, Turkey's winter needs):** P(E | H) ~30%, as dependence might not prevent cessation if overridden by geopolitics. P(E | ~H) ~80%, as stability incentives are strong without disruption. Likelihood ratio: ~0.375 (30%/80%). This decreases the probability.

- **Turkey's new LNG deals (Sep 2025):** P(E | H) ~40%, as alternatives might embolden disputes. P(E | ~H) ~70%, as deals reduce desperation for Russian gas. Likelihood ratio: ~0.57 (40%/70%). This moderately decreases the probability.

- **EU phase-out of Russian gas (Aug 2025 analysis):** P(E | H) ~60%, as it could make Russia more willing to disrupt. P(E | ~H) ~40%, as phase-out is gradual. Likelihood ratio: ~1.5 (60%/40%). This slightly increases the probability.

Overall, the evidence skews upward due to strong kinetic threats, tempered by stability incentives.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior odds of 1:24 (P(H) = 4%).

Combine likelihood ratios qualitatively then quantitatively for key updates. First, major upward evidence (Ukrainian attacks + contract risks + EU phase-out): Net LR ≈ 4 * 1.75 * 1.5 ≈ 10.5. Updated odds: 1:24 * 10.5 ≈ 10.5:24 ≈ 1:2.29 (posterior P ≈ 30%, using P = odds / (1 + odds)).

Now incorporate downward evidence (economic dependence + LNG deals): Net LR ≈ 0.375 * 0.57 ≈ 0.21. Final odds: 1:2.29 * 0.21 ≈ 0.21:2.29 ≈ 1:10.9 (posterior P ≈ 8%, but this feels too low—wait, recalibrating the netting: Downward LR is mitigating, so perhaps aggregate as prior odds * (up LR / down LR) for balance. Net LR ≈ 10.5 / (0.375 * 0.57) ≈ 10.5 / 0.21 ≈ 50. Updated odds: 1:24 * 50 ≈ 50:24 ≈ 2.08:1 (P ≈ 68%—too high).

This swing is excessive per calibration guidance (avoid big swings). Refining: Treat as sequential small updates. Start at 4%. Update for attacks (LR=4): Odds 1:24 → 4:24 → 1:6 (P=14%). Add contract risk (LR=1.75): 1.75:6 → ~0.29:1 (wait, odds multiply: 1:6 * 1.75 = 1.75:6 ≈ 1:3.43, P=23%). Add EU (LR=1.5): 1.5:3.43 ≈ 1:2.29, P=30%. Subtract dependence (LR=0.375): 0.375:2.29 ≈ 1:6.11, P=14%. Subtract LNG (LR=0.57): 0.57:6.11 ≈ 1:10.72, P=9%.

The resulting posterior is around 9%, reflecting small evidence-weighted updates from the base rate. Confidence remains moderate due to information asymmetry and resolution ambiguity around "unexpectedly," with uncertainty in the 5-15% range.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be underconfident by downplaying the "sui generis" war escalation—Ukrainian capabilities could lead to a successful strike, pushing probability to 20-30% if I overweight recent attacks. Blind spot: Over-relying on unverified Russian claims; if they're exaggerated, the kinetic risk is lower, supporting <5%. Tail risks include a sudden Black Sea escalation (e.g., major naval clash) causing cessation (5% chance of extreme scenario), or a quick contract resolution de-escalating everything (reducing to ~2%). Best alternative forecast: 25%, plausible if viewing Nord Stream as a direct precedent (100% in that case, but adjusted for differences), rebutted by stronger mutual incentives here and no prior success against TurkStream. Adjusting slightly upward for tails, my range widens to 7-15%, centering at 11%.

Final: 11%
