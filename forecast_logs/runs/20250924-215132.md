  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for PSOE finishing ahead of PP in the polls can be informed by historical polling data and election outcomes. Historically, PSOE and PP have been the two dominant parties in Spain, often alternating in leadership. Given the current polling data where PP leads with 34% and PSOE at 28%, a reasonable base rate might reflect the historical competitiveness of these parties. A prior probability of 30% for PSOE finishing ahead seems reasonable, reflecting their current deficit but also their historical ability to close gaps.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: Both parties have historically been competitive, and PSOE has previously managed to close polling gaps through coalition-building and strategic campaigning.
       - Differences: The current polling gap is significant (6%), and there are no scheduled elections in 2025, which might limit opportunities for dramatic shifts in public opinion. However, political dynamics can change rapidly, especially with potential economic or social developments.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Current Polls: PP leads by 6%, suggesting a lower likelihood of PSOE overtaking without significant changes. This evidence decreases the probability of PSOE finishing ahead.
       - Coalition Government: PSOE's ability to form a government despite losing the election indicates political maneuverability, which could increase their chances of improving poll standings.
       - Economic/Social Factors: Any major economic or social changes could impact public opinion. Without specific evidence, this remains neutral but is a potential factor for change.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds for PSOE ahead: 0.3 / 0.7 = 0.4286
       - Likelihood ratio (considering current polls and coalition potential): Assume a modest likelihood ratio of 0.8 (since current polls are unfavorable but coalition potential is a positive factor).
       - Posterior odds = 0.4286 * 0.8 = 0.3429
       - Posterior probability = 0.3429 / (1 + 0.3429) ≈ 0.255 or 25.5%
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence Risk: The current polling gap is significant, and without elections, shifts might be limited. However, unforeseen events could alter dynamics.
       - Alternative Scenario: A major scandal or economic downturn could significantly impact PP's standing, benefiting PSOE. Conversely, strong economic performance could solidify PP's lead.
       - Adjustments: Given the potential for unforeseen events, a slight upward adjustment to account for uncertainty might be warranted.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - Considering the base rate, current evidence, and potential for change, a final probability of 28% for PSOE finishing ahead of PP in the polls by the end of 2025 seems reasonable.
    
    Final: 28%
