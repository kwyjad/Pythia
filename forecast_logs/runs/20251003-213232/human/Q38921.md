### Reference class & base rates
-   **Fed Policy Continuation within a Quarter (3 months to resolution):** Once the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) initiates a clear policy direction (either hiking or cutting), it is rare for them to reverse course within the same quarter. Looking at modern Fed history (post-1990), reversals within 3-4 months without a major exogenous shock (e.g., major financial crisis, war) are virtually nonexistent.
    -   *Base Rate:* The probability that the Fed does *not* reverse a newly established cutting cycle within 3 months is likely **>95%**. This class suggests a very high probability for "Yes".
-   **Accuracy of Near-Term FOMC Projections (Dot Plots):** With only one or two meetings left in the year, the September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP or "dot plot") is a relatively reliable indicator of the year-end policy rate. Deviations occur, but they typically require significant, unexpected economic data. The September 2025 dot plot, per the sources, projects 50 bps of further cuts.
    -   *Base Rate:* The year-end rate lands at or below the September median dot plot projection roughly **80-90%** of the time. This class also suggests a high probability for "Yes".
-   **Limitations:** Both reference classes assume a stable economic regime. A sudden geopolitical event or financial shock could invalidate these historical precedents. The current context of unwinding post-pandemic inflation is also somewhat novel.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-09-29] Investopedia article notes market expectations for a 25 bps cut at the upcoming October meeting. — ↓ — Shows market consensus is aligned with further easing, making a surprise hold or hike less likely as the Fed avoids shocking markets.
-   [2025-09-24] Advisor Perspectives reports the Fed cut rates by 25 bps at the September meeting to 4.00-4.25%. — ↓ — This action is the most significant recent event, confirming the easing cycle and lowering the current rate below the 4.33% resolution threshold.
-   [2025-09-17] Nuveen commentary on the September meeting highlights the dot plot showing 50 bps of additional cuts expected in 2025. — ↓ — This is explicit forward guidance from the FOMC itself, creating a strong presumption of at least two more 25 bps cuts by year-end.
-   [2025-08-20] July FOMC minutes show the committee held rates at 4.25-4.50%, noting moderated activity but persistent uncertainty. — (Neutral) — This "hold" is now outdated by the September cut, but it shows the committee's data-dependent and cautious approach.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Inflation Data (CPI, PCE):** The primary driver. A significant upside surprise in core inflation is the most plausible catalyst for a policy reversal (i.e., a hike). A series of hot reports could cause the FOMC to panic. (Size: Large)
-   **Labor Market Data (Jobs Reports, Unemployment):** The other half of the dual mandate. The provided sources cite "signs of weakness" and "downside risks" as the justification for cuts. Further deterioration would accelerate cuts; a sudden re-tightening could cause a pause. (Size: Moderate-to-Large)
-   **FOMC Communications (Speeches, Minutes, Dot Plots):** The Fed's own forward guidance. Hawkish rhetoric from key officials or a surprisingly hawkish dot plot in December could signal a reversal, but this is a lagging indicator of their reaction to data. (Size: Large)
-   **Financial Stability & Credit Conditions:** A sudden credit crunch or market crisis would almost certainly lock in further rate cuts. Conversely, signs of a speculative bubble re-inflating could be a minor factor arguing against deep cuts. (Size: Moderate)
-   **Exogenous Shocks (Geopolitical, Supply-Side):** An event that causes a spike in energy or commodity prices could reignite inflation fears and force the Fed to reconsider its easing path. This is a low-probability, high-impact driver. (Size: Large)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Starting Point is Already Favorable:** The most significant difference is that the current Federal Funds Rate (target 4.00-4.25%, effective rate ~4.10%) is *already below* the 4.33% resolution threshold. A "No" outcome requires not just a pause, but an active rate *hike* before year-end.
-   **Nature of the Easing Cycle:** Unlike crisis-driven easing cycles (e.g., 2008, 2020) that involve rapid, large cuts, this cycle appears to be a more gradual "soft landing" adjustment. This could imply more data-dependency and less forward momentum, though a full reversal is still unlikely.
-   **Lingering Inflation Concerns:** The Fed is cutting rates while inflation, though falling, is still described as "somewhat elevated" (July minutes). In many past cycles, cuts began when inflation was already at or below the 2% target, making the Fed less sensitive to upside inflation surprises.
-   **Impending Framework Review:** The 2025 monetary policy framework review introduces a background uncertainty. While unlikely to impact tactical decisions in the next 3 months, it could subtly influence the risk management posture of some committee members.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Based on the reference class of policy continuation, a reasonable prior for "Yes" would be ~90%, with an equivalent n of ~15, reflecting the strong historical precedent against near-term policy reversals.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ Large) The September rate cut and the current rate being below the 4.33% threshold. This is the strongest piece of evidence.
    -   (↑ Moderate) The September dot plot explicitly signaling 50 bps of additional cuts before year-end.
    -   (↑ Small) Market expectations are fully pricing in at least one more cut, creating a high bar for the Fed to surprise hawkishly.
    -   (↓ Small) The Fed's own language acknowledging that inflation remains "somewhat elevated," which represents the primary risk factor for a hawkish pivot.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly confirms the high prior. The posterior probability should move upwards, likely into the **95-98% range**. The path to a "No" resolution is exceptionally narrow.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (favoring YES - rates stay lower):**
    -   Core PCE inflation prints at or below 0.2% month-over-month.
    -   Nonfarm Payrolls reports showing job growth <100k or an uptick in the unemployment rate.
    -   Dovish commentary from Fed Chair/governors emphasizing labor market risks over inflation.
    -   A 25 bps rate cut at the October 28-29 FOMC meeting.
-   **DOWN indicators (favoring NO - rates could rise above):**
    -   Core PCE inflation prints above 0.4% month-over-month for two consecutive months (October, November data).
    -   A major geopolitical event causing a >20% spike in oil prices.
    -   Unexpectedly hawkish minutes from the October meeting, or key governors publicly questioning the need for more cuts.
    -   A surprise "hold" on rates at the October meeting.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Resolution Definition:** The question resolves on the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR) for a single day, Dec 31, 2025. While extremely unlikely, severe year-end liquidity/funding stress could theoretically cause a one-day spike in the EFFR, even if the FOMC's target range is lower.
-   **Data Revisions:** Economic data is often revised. A series of upward revisions to past inflation or employment data could change the Fed's perception of the economy's strength.
-   **Black Swan Event:** The forecast is highly vulnerable to a low-probability, high-impact event (e.g., major conflict, new supply chain crisis) that fundamentally alters the inflation outlook in the next 12 weeks.
-   **Fed Communication vs. Action:** While the dot plot is a strong signal, it is not a promise. The committee can and will change its mind if the data changes dramatically.

To forecast whether US federal interest rates at the end of 2025 will be lower than at the end of 2024, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the Fed not reversing a newly established cutting cycle within 3 months is >95%. This is based on historical data showing that once the Fed initiates a policy direction, it rarely reverses within a short period unless there is a major exogenous shock.
   - Initial prior probability for "Yes" (rates will be lower) is set at 90%, reflecting the strong historical precedent against near-term policy reversals.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The Fed has initiated a rate-cutting cycle, and the current rate is already below the threshold for a "Yes" resolution.
   - Differences: The current easing cycle is gradual and data-dependent, with lingering inflation concerns. However, these differences do not significantly alter the high probability of continued rate cuts.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - September rate cut and current rate below the threshold: Strong evidence for "Yes" (↑ Large).
   - September dot plot signaling further cuts: Moderate evidence for "Yes" (↑ Moderate).
   - Market expectations for further cuts: Small evidence for "Yes" (↑ Small).
   - Fed's acknowledgment of elevated inflation: Small evidence against "Yes" (↓ Small).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds for "Yes" = 9:1 (90% probability).
   - Likelihood ratio from evidence strongly supports "Yes," moving the posterior probability upwards.
   - Posterior probability is adjusted to approximately 95-98%, given the strong alignment of evidence with the prior.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks such as geopolitical events or unexpected inflation spikes that could force a policy reversal.
   - Alternative forecast: A sudden economic shock could lead to a rate hike, but this is a low-probability scenario.
   - Adjustments: Given the robustness of the evidence and historical precedent, the forecast remains confident in the high range.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - The final forecast reflects both the base rate and the impact of the evidence, resulting in a high probability that rates will be lower at the end of 2025 compared to the end of 2024.

Final: 97%

# Will US federal interest rates at the end of 2025 be lower than at the end of 2024?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability that US federal interest rates at the end of 2025 will be lower than the end of 2024 threshold of 4.33%.

The most appropriate reference class is the continuation of an established Fed policy direction within a short timeframe (3 months until year-end). Based on modern Fed history (post-1990), once the FOMC establishes a clear cutting cycle, reversals within 3-4 months are extremely rare without major exogenous shocks.

Key facts supporting this base rate:
- The Fed has already begun a cutting cycle with the September 2025 cut to 4.00-4.25%
- The current effective rate (~4.10%) is already below the resolution threshold of 4.33%
- The Fed's own projections (dot plot) indicate 50 bps of additional cuts by year-end

**Prior probability: 95%** (or odds of 19:1 in favor of rates remaining lower)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The Fed is following a typical gradual easing cycle pattern
- Economic data is showing moderation in activity consistent with a soft landing
- Market expectations align with the Fed's projected path (expecting further cuts)
- The FOMC has explicitly signaled further cuts in their September projections

**Differences from base case:**
- The current rate is already below the resolution threshold, meaning a "No" would require not just a pause but an actual rate hike
- This easing cycle follows an unusually rapid tightening cycle to combat post-pandemic inflation
- Inflation, while moderating, is still described as "somewhat elevated" compared to the 2% target
- The Fed is conducting a monetary policy framework review in 2025, which adds a minor background uncertainty

These differences mostly strengthen the case for a "Yes" resolution, as the bar for a "No" is exceptionally high - requiring not just a pause in cuts but an actual reversal to hiking.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: September 2025 rate cut to 4.00-4.25%**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If rates will remain lower, we would expect to see the Fed already cutting
- P(E|~H): Very low (~0.05) - If rates were to end higher, the Fed would likely not have cut in September
- Likelihood ratio: ~19:1 in favor of "Yes"
- This strongly increases the probability of a "Yes" resolution

**Evidence 2: September dot plot showing 50 bps of additional cuts expected in 2025**
- P(E|H): High (~0.9) - If rates will remain lower, we would expect the Fed to project further cuts
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.1) - If rates were to end higher, the dot plot would likely show a pause or hike
- Likelihood ratio: ~9:1 in favor of "Yes"
- This significantly increases the probability of a "Yes" resolution

**Evidence 3: Market expectations for a 25 bps cut at the October meeting**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If rates will remain lower, markets would price in further cuts
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Markets can be wrong, especially if new data emerges
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.7:1 in favor of "Yes"
- This moderately increases the probability of a "Yes" resolution

**Evidence 4: Inflation remains "somewhat elevated"**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - Even with elevated inflation, the Fed can continue cutting if it's on a downward trend
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Elevated inflation is a prerequisite for a potential rate hike
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.86:1 slightly against "Yes"
- This very slightly decreases the probability of a "Yes" resolution

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior odds of 19:1 (95% probability), I'll update based on the strongest piece of evidence - the September rate cut:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 19:1 × 19:1 = 361:1

Converting to probability:
Posterior probability = 361/(361+1) ≈ 99.7%

This seems too high given the remaining uncertainty, so I'll temper this with the "elevated inflation" evidence:

Updated posterior odds = 361:1 × 0.86:1 ≈ 310:1
Updated posterior probability = 310/(310+1) ≈ 99.7%

The evidence overwhelmingly supports a "Yes" resolution, but I should be cautious about overconfidence. The primary risk factors are:
1. A sudden inflation spike in the next 3 months
2. A major geopolitical shock affecting energy prices
3. A financial stability event requiring policy reversal

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the likelihood of a significant inflation resurgence
- The Fed's framework review could theoretically lead to unexpected policy shifts
- Market liquidity issues at year-end could temporarily push the effective rate above the threshold
- A new Fed Chair or significant FOMC membership changes could alter policy direction

**Alternative forecast:**
The strongest case for a lower probability would be based on the possibility of multiple consecutive high inflation prints in October-November, combined with a geopolitical shock affecting energy prices. This could force the Fed to signal a pause or even a hike by December.

However, even in this scenario, the Fed would need to:
1. Completely reverse its current easing bias
2. Signal a hike in its communications
3. Actually implement a hike of at least 25 bps
4. Do all this within approximately 12 weeks

The combination of these requirements makes the alternative forecast highly implausible.

**Adjustment for uncertainty:**
While the mathematical Bayesian update suggests a probability above 99%, I should acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting and the possibility of unforeseen events. A more calibrated forecast would be slightly lower.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence, the base rate, and potential uncertainties, I assess that US federal interest rates at the end of 2025 will be lower than the end of 2024 threshold of 4.33% with high confidence.

The current rate is already below the threshold, the Fed has explicitly signaled further cuts, and the timeframe is too short for a complete policy reversal without extraordinary circumstances.

Final: 97%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Base Rate:** The most appropriate base rate is the historical frequency of the Federal Reserve reversing a monetary policy direction (i.e., from cutting to hiking) within a single quarter (3 months).
*   **Reasoning:** The Fed initiated a rate-cutting cycle at its September 2025 meeting. Modern Fed history (post-1990) shows that such abrupt reversals within 3-4 months are extremely rare, typically only occurring in response to a severe, unforeseen shock. The reference class suggests that once a clear direction is set, policy momentum continues for at least the next one or two meetings.
*   **Initial Prior:** Based on this reference class, the prior probability that the Fed will *not* hike rates in the next 3 months after initiating a cutting cycle is very high. I will set the prior P(H) at **95%**. This corresponds to prior odds of 19:1 in favor of the event.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current situation aligns well with the base case of a central bank having just started a well-telegraphed easing cycle driven by moderating inflation and a softening labor market.
*   **Differences:** The most significant difference makes the current situation *stronger* than the base case. The September 2025 rate cut has already brought the target range to 4.00-4.25%. The Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR) is therefore already trading around 4.10%, which is well below the resolution threshold of 4.33%. For the event to resolve "No", the Fed would not just have to pause its cutting cycle; it would need to actively *hike* rates at one of the two remaining meetings in 2025. This is a much higher bar than simply not continuing with cuts.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key evidence relative to the 95% prior.

*   **Evidence 1: The current EFFR is already below the 4.33% threshold.**
    *   P(E | H): If rates end 2025 below 4.33% (H), it is extremely likely that they would be below that level after the first cut of the cycle. P(E|H) ≈ 1.
    *   P(E | ~H): If rates end 2025 at or above 4.33% (~H), it is extremely *unlikely* that the Fed would have just cut rates to ~4.10%. This would require a contradictory and confidence-damaging "cut-then-hike" maneuver within three months. P(E|~H) is very low.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very large and positive (>>1). This evidence strongly increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The September 2025 FOMC dot plot projects 50 bps of additional cuts by year-end.**
    *   P(E | H): This is the Fed's explicit forward guidance. If they intend to end the year with lower rates, it is very likely they would signal this in their projections. P(E|H) is high.
    *   P(E | ~H): If the Fed were to hike rates by December, it would mean their own projections were completely wrong just three months prior. This is highly improbable without a major intervening shock. P(E|~H) is extremely low.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very large and positive (>>1). This evidence also strongly increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Fed commentary acknowledges inflation remains "somewhat elevated".**
    *   P(E | H): The Fed can continue its gradual cutting cycle while still being cautious and acknowledging that inflation isn't fully back to target. This language is consistent with a "soft landing" approach. P(E|H) is high.
    *   P(E | ~H): This language is a necessary precondition for a hike. The only reason the Fed would hike is if they panicked about this "elevated" inflation re-accelerating. P(E|~H) is also high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Close to 1, but slightly less than 1. This is the primary source of the remaining uncertainty and slightly decreases the probability from an extremely high level.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Prior Odds:** 19:1 (95% probability).
*   **Updating:** The first two pieces of evidence (the current rate and the dot plot) are overwhelming. They establish a clear path and a high bar for reversal. The combined likelihood ratio from this evidence is very large. If we estimate it conservatively at 10, the posterior odds would become 19 * 10 = 190:1, which is ~99.5%.
*   The counter-evidence (cautious inflation language) tempers this extreme confidence. It represents the primary risk scenario: a series of hot inflation reports could force the Fed's hand. Let's model this risk. The probability of two consecutive, surprisingly hot inflation reports (for Sept/Oct) might be around 2-3%. Even if that happens, the Fed's most likely reaction would be to pause, not to immediately hike. The probability of a hike, even with bad data, is likely less than 50%. This suggests the total probability of a hike is in the 1-2% range.
*   **Posterior Probability:** This calculation suggests the final probability should be in the 98-99% range. The evidence strongly confirms and strengthens the already high prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Best Alternative Forecast (Why "No" could happen):** The most plausible path to a "No" resolution involves a stagflationary shock. For example, a major geopolitical conflict causes oil prices to spike, leading to a surge in headline inflation. Simultaneously, labor market data for October and November comes in much stronger than expected. Faced with re-accelerating inflation and no clear economic slowdown, the Fed panics at its December meeting and enacts a "credibility-saving" 25 bps hike. This would push the EFFR above 4.33%.
*   **Rebuttal:** This scenario requires a conjunction of several low-probability events. The Fed would be extremely reluctant to hike into a potential global slowdown caused by an energy shock, and the bar for reversing a policy decision so quickly is immense. A pause would be a far more likely outcome.
*   **Overconfidence:** My estimate is very high. The Manifold market at 96.6% suggests the community sees a slightly higher chance of failure (~3.4%). This might be due to a higher perceived probability of an exogenous shock or the market being slightly less confident in general at the extremes. However, my analysis of the direct evidence and the specific resolution criteria (requiring an active hike) supports a probability higher than the market's. I will adjust slightly down from my highest estimate to account for this uncertainty and tail risk.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate against a policy reversal is very high (95%). The evidence, particularly the fact that the current rate is already below the resolution threshold and the Fed's own projections signal further cuts, is overwhelmingly supportive. The only plausible path to failure requires a sequence of low-probability events (e.g., multiple inflation shocks plus an extreme Fed reaction). This leads to a very high posterior probability.

Final: 98%
