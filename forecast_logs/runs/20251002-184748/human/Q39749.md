### Reference class & base rates
1.  **NYC Marathon Men's Winning Times (2010-2023):** This is the most specific reference class. It accounts for the unique difficulty of the course.
    *   **Range:** 7,498s (2:04:58) to 7,853s (2:10:53).
    *   **Mean:** 7,688s (2:08:08).
    *   **Median:** 7,698s (2:08:18).
    *   **Reasoning:** This period captures the modern era of marathon running, including the initial impact of advanced shoe technology. It reflects the reality of a challenging, tactical course that is not conducive to world-record attempts. The 2023 course record of 2:04:58 is a significant outlier on the fast side.
2.  **World Marathon Majors (WMM) Men's Winning Times (2022-2024):** This class reflects the current state of elite talent, training, and technology on a variety of courses.
    *   **Ballpark Range:** 7,235s (2:00:35) to 7,753s (2:09:13).
    *   **Ballpark Mean:** ~7,470s (2:04:30).
    *   **Reasoning:** This captures the absolute peak of current performance, heavily influenced by the flat, fast courses of Berlin and Chicago. It provides a lower bound on what the current generation of athletes is capable of under ideal conditions, highlighting the "course penalty" for NYC.
3.  **Non-Record-Setting WMM Winning Times (Boston/Tokyo, 2022-2024):** This class is a better comparison for course difficulty. Boston is hilly and not record-eligible; Tokyo can have variable weather.
    *   **Ballpark Range:** 7,545s (2:05:45) to 7,753s (2:09:13).
    *   **Ballpark Mean:** ~7,620s (2:07:00).
    *   **Reasoning:** This filters for major races on more challenging courses, providing a tighter and more realistic comparison for NYC than the full WMM set.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-10-13** Ruth Chepng'etich shatters women's world record in Chicago (2:09:56). **(↓)** Matters because it demonstrates that shoe technology and training methods are still pushing boundaries, raising the ceiling for what's considered possible.
*   **2024-09-29** Berlin Marathon won in a fast, but not record-breaking, time (e.g., ~2:02:15). **(↔)** Matters because it shows the top tier of athletes remains exceptionally fast, but that Kiptum's 2:00:35 is a very high bar.
*   **2024-08-10** Paris Olympics Men's Marathon won in a tactical ~2:06:30. **(↑)** Matters because it highlights that on challenging courses and in championship-style (no pacemakers) races, even the best in the world run significantly slower, tactical races.
*   **2024-04-15** Boston Marathon won in ~2:06:15 on its difficult, hilly course. **(↑)** Matters as it provides a recent data point for a challenging course, reinforcing that times in the 2:06-2:08 range are excellent results for non-flat courses.
*   **2024-02-11** World record holder Kelvin Kiptum dies. **(↑)** Matters because the single athlete most likely to dramatically lower marathon times is no longer competing, potentially reducing the pressure for ultra-fast, record-chasing paces in major races.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Course Difficulty (Large, ↑):** The NYC course, with its five bridges and undulating hills, is inherently slower than record-friendly courses like Chicago or Berlin. This consistently adds 2-4 minutes to elite times. This is the dominant factor.
2.  **Race Day Weather (Large, ↑/↓):** Temperature, wind, and humidity are critical. Ideal conditions (cool, ~8-12°C, calm) can enable a fast time. Headwinds or unseasonable warmth (>15°C) can easily add 1-3 minutes.
3.  **Elite Field Composition & Race Dynamics (Moderate, ↑/↓):** The specific athletes competing determine the race strategy. A field with multiple aggressive, sub-2:05 runners can push the pace. A single dominant favorite may opt for a safer, more tactical "sit-and-kick" race, leading to a slower time.
4.  **Pacing Strategy (Moderate, ↓):** The presence and quality of pacemakers, and their target splits, are key for any attempt at a fast time. An aggressive pacing strategy from the start is a prerequisite for a time near the course record.
5.  **Shoe Technology (Small, ↓):** The "super shoe" revolution has already lowered baseline times across the board. While incremental improvements continue, the large step-change effect from ~2017-2020 is now the status quo. Its effect is sustained, not a new shock.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Post-Kiptum Era:** The sport is adjusting to the tragic loss of its most transformative talent. Without Kiptum pushing the absolute limits, the psychological pressure to run near 2:00:00 may be reduced, potentially leading to more conservative racing among the top contenders.
*   **Sustained Technology Plateau:** Unlike the early years of carbon-plate shoes where gains were rapid, the technology has matured. The base rate of winning times from 2021-2024 is a better reflection of the current reality than a longer-term historical average.
*   **Post-Olympic Year:** The 2025 race follows the 2024 Paris Olympics. Top athletes may be recovering from a grueling Olympic cycle, have altered training schedules, or be less focused on a fast time compared to a non-Olympic year.
*   **Deepening Elite Field:** While Kiptum was an outlier, the number of men capable of running sub-2:05 has grown. This depth increases the chance of a competitive, fast race even if no single runner is attempting a world record.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A distribution centered on the recent NYC winning times (Reference Class 1), with a mean around **7,680 seconds (2:08:00)**. The 2023 course record suggests a left-skewed tail. Give this an equivalent n of ~10, reflecting the last decade of stable course/race conditions.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **(↑ Large)** The death of Kelvin Kiptum removes the primary downward force on elite times and may encourage more tactical racing.
    *   **(↑ Moderate)** The 2024 Olympic and Boston marathon results reinforce that difficult courses produce slower, tactical times in the 2:06+ range.
    *   **(↓ Moderate)** The continued sub-2:03 times at flat marathons (Berlin/Chicago) and the women's WR show that the overall environment of training and technology remains conducive to very fast running.
    *   **(↓ Small)** The 2023 course record (7,498s) proves a sub-2:05 is possible on the day, pulling the expectation slightly lower than the historical mean.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is mixed but leans slightly toward a slower time than the absolute fastest potential. The posterior should shift slightly upward (slower) from the 2023 record but remain faster than the 10-year mean. A central estimate around **7,600 seconds (2:06:40)** seems plausible, acknowledging significant uncertainty driven by weather and field composition.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (slower time):**
    *   Weather forecast for race day (Nov 2, 2025) shows temperatures >15°C (60°F) or winds >15 mph.
    *   The announced elite field lacks a clear rivalry or multiple athletes with sub-2:04 personal bests.
    *   Pre-race interviews with top contenders emphasize "competing to win" over "running a fast time."
    *   Key athletes announced for the field have a

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most appropriate base rate for the NYC Marathon men's winning times is the historical data from 2010-2023, which reflects the unique challenges of the NYC course. The mean winning time during this period is 7,688 seconds (2:08:08), with a range from 7,498 seconds (2:04:58) to 7,853 seconds (2:10:53).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The NYC Marathon course remains the same, with its challenging terrain and tactical nature. The base rate captures the impact of these factors.
   - Differences: The death of Kelvin Kiptum and the maturation of shoe technology suggest a potential shift in elite racing dynamics, possibly leading to more tactical races and slightly slower times compared to the fastest possible outcomes.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The absence of Kiptum (↑) suggests a potential for slower, more tactical races.
   - Recent fast times in Berlin and Chicago (↓) indicate that the top athletes are still capable of very fast performances under ideal conditions.
   - The 2024 Olympic and Boston results (↑) reinforce the expectation of slower times on challenging courses.
   - The 2023 NYC course record (↓) shows that sub-2:05 is possible, albeit under exceptional conditions.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 7,680 seconds, the evidence suggests a slight upward shift due to the absence of Kiptum and the tactical nature of recent races. However, the potential for fast times remains due to ongoing advancements in training and technology. The posterior distribution is adjusted to reflect a central estimate around 7,600 seconds (2:06:40), with a wider spread to account for uncertainty.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks includes potential adverse weather conditions and the composition of the elite field. The possibility of a breakthrough performance by an emerging athlete or exceptionally favorable weather could lead to faster times. Conversely, poor weather or a lack of competition could result in slower times. The forecast accounts for these scenarios by maintaining a wider distribution.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the central estimate and the range of possible outcomes, considering both the potential for fast times and the likelihood of tactical racing.

P10: 7,520
P20: 7,560
P40: 7,600
P60: 7,640

# Forecasting the 2025 NYC Marathon Men's Winning Time

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use the NYC Marathon Men's winning times from 2010-2023 as my primary reference distribution:
- Range: 7,498s (2:04:58) to 7,853s (2:10:53)
- Mean: 7,688s (2:08:08)
- Median: 7,698s (2:08:18)
- Standard deviation: ~90 seconds (estimated from the range)

This is the most appropriate base rate because:
1. It accounts for the specific course characteristics of NYC (bridges, hills, etc.)
2. It captures the modern era of marathon running, including technological advances
3. It provides sufficient sample size while remaining relevant to current conditions

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The course remains unchanged, with the same challenging bridges and terrain
- The race continues to attract elite international competition
- The event maintains its position in the fall marathon calendar
- Carbon-plate shoe technology is now standard across the elite field

**Differences from base rate:**
- The 2023 course record (7,498s) represents a significant improvement over previous years
- The loss of world record holder Kelvin Kiptum removes a potential record-setting talent
- The 2025 race follows an Olympic year, which can affect athlete preparation and focus
- The depth of sub-2:05 marathon runners continues to increase globally

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing toward faster times (lower seconds):**
1. The 2023 NYC course record (7,498s) demonstrates the course can produce times under 2:05 with the right conditions and competition (strong evidence, ~1.5x likelihood for faster times)
2. Continued fast performances at other major marathons suggest the talent pool remains exceptionally strong (moderate evidence, ~1.3x likelihood for faster times)
3. Women's marathon world record progression indicates training methods and technology continue to advance (weak evidence, ~1.1x likelihood for faster times)

**Evidence pushing toward slower times (higher seconds):**
1. The NYC course is inherently slower than record-setting courses like Berlin/Chicago (strong evidence, ~1.7x likelihood for slower times)
2. The loss of Kiptum removes a driving force for extremely fast times (moderate evidence, ~1.3x likelihood for slower times)
3. Post-Olympic year scheduling may mean top athletes are in recovery or transition phases (moderate evidence, ~1.2x likelihood for slower times)
4. Historical NYC winning times cluster more around 2:08 than 2:05 (strong evidence, ~1.5x likelihood for slower times)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 7,688s (mean of 2010-2023 NYC winning times):

**First update - Course record effect:**
The 2023 course record (7,498s) pulls my distribution lower. This represents a significant outlier that suggests the course can be faster than previously thought.
- Prior mean: 7,688s
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5x in favor of faster times
- Posterior mean shifts to ~7,620s

**Second update - Course difficulty vs. talent pool:**
The inherent difficulty of NYC's course compared to record-setting courses, balanced against the deepening elite talent pool.
- Updated prior mean: 7,620s
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3x in favor of slower times
- Posterior mean shifts to ~7,650s

**Third update - Post-Olympic year effect:**
Considering the 2025 race follows the Paris Olympics, with potential impacts on athlete preparation.
- Updated prior mean: 7,650s
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.2x in favor of slower times
- Posterior mean shifts to ~7,670s

**Final posterior distribution:**
- Mean: ~7,670s (2:07:50)
- The distribution is slightly left-skewed (faster times have longer tails)
- Standard deviation: ~100s (slightly wider than prior due to uncertainty)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. I may be underestimating the impact of continued technological advances in running shoes
2. Weather conditions on race day could dramatically affect times (±2-3 minutes)
3. The specific composition of the elite field is unknown and highly influential
4. I might be overweighting the "post-Olympic effect" when many top marathoners skip the Olympics

**Alternative scenarios:**
1. **Faster scenario (P10):** Perfect weather conditions, aggressive pacemaking, and multiple sub-2:04 athletes create a record-breaking race (~7,480s)
2. **Slower scenario (P90):** Warm weather, tactical racing with no pacemakers, and absence of top talent leads to a conservative winning time (~7,850s)

**Adjustments for uncertainty:**
- Widening my distribution to account for weather variability
- Ensuring my P10 accommodates the possibility of another course record
- Allowing for a longer right tail to account for tactical racing scenarios

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 7,500
P20: 7,560
P40: 7,640
P60: 7,700
P80: 7,780
P90: 7,850

Answering the question: What will be the winning times for the 2025 New York City marathon? (Men)
Units: Seconds

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The primary reference class is the set of winning times for the Men's NYC Marathon in the modern era, specifically from 2010 to 2023 (excluding cancelled years). This period captures the current course, race dynamics, and the impact of advancing technology.

*   **Data (12 races):**
    *   Mean: 7,691 seconds (2:08:11)
    *   Median: 7,698 seconds (2:08:18)
    *   Range: 7,498s (2:04:58) to 7,859s (2:11:00)
    *   Standard Deviation: ~125 seconds

This historical data forms a prior distribution centered around **2:08:15**, with significant variance driven by race-day conditions and tactics.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The course remains the same, known for its bridges and hills, making it significantly slower than record-eligible courses like Berlin or Chicago. The race's prestige ensures a world-class field.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Shoe Technology:** The "super shoe" era is now mature. The base rate includes pre-2017 times. The average winning time since 2017 is ~7,671s (2:07:51), about 20 seconds faster than the longer-term average, suggesting a downward shift in the baseline.
    *   **Post-Kiptum Era:** The tragic death of world record holder Kelvin Kiptum removes the single athlete who was most aggressively pushing the limits of the sport. His absence may lead to more conservative, tactical racing globally, exerting upward pressure on times.
    *   **Post-Olympic Year:** 2025 follows the 2024 Paris Olympics. Top athletes may be recovering or have altered training schedules, which could lead to a slightly less sharp field and a slower winning time.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
*   **(Strong Downward Pressure) 2023 Course Record:** Tamirat Tola's winning time of 7,498s (2:04:58) in 2023 was a significant outlier. It provides powerful evidence that a sub-2:05 time is possible on this course with the right athlete and conditions, pulling the entire forecast distribution towards faster times.
*   **(Moderate Upward Pressure) Absence of Kiptum:** Without the athlete who ran 2:00:35, the psychological barrier of a 2:00-2:02 marathon is restored. This makes an ultra-aggressive, record-chasing race less likely, increasing the probability of a more tactical affair with a winning time in the 2:06-2:08 range.
*   **(Sustained Downward Pressure) Mature Technology:** The performance benefits of carbon-plated shoes are now the status quo. This technology makes times in the 2:05-2:07 range more accessible than they were a decade ago, even on a tough course.
*   **(Major Uncertainty Driver) Weather & Tactics:** Race day weather (wind, temperature) is the largest variable and can easily swing the winning time by 2-3 minutes. A warm/windy day or a purely tactical race would lead to a time of 2:09+, while a perfect day is a prerequisite for a fast time. This factor primarily widens the distribution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** Centered at ~7,700s (2:08:20) based on historical NYC data.
*   **Update:** The powerful evidence of the 2023 course record (7,498s) and mature shoe technology pulls the distribution significantly to the left (faster). However, the death of Kiptum and the post-Olympic year context provide a countervailing push to the right (slower), making a repeat of 2023's exceptional time less likely.
*   **Posterior:** The resulting posterior distribution should have a median significantly faster than the historical 2:08:18, but not as fast as the 2023 record. I'll center my distribution around **7,660 seconds (2:07:40)**. The distribution will be wide to account for weather uncertainty and will have a slight right skew, as there are more factors that can make a race slow (bad weather, tactics) than exceptionally fast.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Forecast:** One could argue that the 2023 time was a massive anomaly and that the true central tendency remains around 2:08:xx, especially without Kiptum to push the pace. In this view, my median of 2:07:40 is too aggressive.
*   **Rebuttal:** While the 2023 time was an outlier, it cannot be ignored. It reset the "art of the possible" for NYC. The general progression of the sport, even without Kiptum, means that the baseline expectation should be faster than it was 5-10 years ago. My median splits the difference between the historical norm and the new record.
*   **Tail Risks:** The low-end tail (P10) accounts for a near-perfect day where an athlete challenges the course record. The high-end tail (P90) accounts for a warm, windy day or a highly tactical race, similar to the outcomes in 2014 or 2017. The P10-P90 range of nearly 6 minutes reflects the high uncertainty.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 7480
P20: 7540
P40: 7620
P60: 7700
P80: 7780
P90: 7830
