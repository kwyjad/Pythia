### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical Cross-Strait Conflicts**: Since 1949, no full-scale invasion has occurred; base rate is effectively 0%.
- **Modern Military Conflicts**: Post-World War II, major powers rarely engage in direct invasions; base rate <5%.
- **Geopolitical Tensions**: Similar high-tension regions (e.g., Korean Peninsula) have low conflict rates; base rate ~1-2%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-09-01] ↑ — China conducted large-scale military exercises near Taiwan, increasing regional tensions.
- [2025-08-15] ↓ — U.S. reaffirmed commitment to Taiwan's defense, potentially deterring Chinese aggression.
- [2025-07-30] ↑ — Reports of increased cyber-attacks on Taiwanese infrastructure, indicating rising hostilities.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Military Capability**: Large — China's growing military strength could enable an invasion.
- **U.S. Deterrence**: Moderate — U.S. military presence and alliances may deter Chinese aggression.
- **Economic Interdependence**: Moderate — High economic costs could dissuade China from invading.
- **Domestic Politics in China**: Small — Internal pressures might push for aggressive actions.
- **International Diplomacy**: Moderate — Global diplomatic efforts could prevent escalation.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Increased Military Exercises**: More frequent and larger in scale than historical norms.
- **Cyber Warfare**: New dimension of conflict not present in past reference cases.
- **Global Economic Ties**: Greater economic interdependence than during past conflicts.
- **U.S. Policy**: Stronger and more explicit support for Taiwan compared to historical norms.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Low probability (~1-2%) based on historical non-invasion and geopolitical norms; equivalent n = 50.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Large — Increased military exercises.
  - ↓ Moderate — U.S. defense commitments.
  - ↑ Small — Cyber-attacks on Taiwan.
  - ↓ Moderate — Economic interdependence.
- **Net effect**: Posterior probability should increase slightly, but remains low due to strong deterrents.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Escalation in military exercises.
  - Breakdown in U.S.-China diplomatic talks.
  - Increased Chinese military presence in the Taiwan Strait.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Renewed diplomatic engagements.
  - Economic sanctions or pressures on China.
  - Public statements from China de-escalating tensions.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Uncertainty in Intentions**: China's strategic goals are opaque.
- **Data Gaps**: Limited access to reliable intelligence on military plans.
- **Deception Risks**: Potential for misinformation or propaganda.
- **Regime Changes**: Political shifts in China or the U.S. could alter dynamics.
- **Definitional Gotchas**: Ambiguity in what constitutes an "invasion."

Final Research Summary: While recent developments suggest a slight increase in the probability of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan by 2025, strong deterrents and historical patterns keep the likelihood low. Forecasters should monitor military activities and diplomatic engagements closely.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the probability of China invading Taiwan in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Historical Cross-Strait Conflicts**: Since 1949, there has been no full-scale invasion of Taiwan by China. This historical non-invasion sets a base rate of effectively 0%.
    - **Modern Military Conflicts**: Major powers rarely engage in direct invasions post-World War II, suggesting a base rate of less than 5%.
    - **Geopolitical Tensions**: Similar high-tension regions, such as the Korean Peninsula, have low conflict rates, suggesting a base rate of around 1-2%.
    
    Given these considerations, a reasonable prior probability for a Chinese invasion of Taiwan in 2025 is around 1-2%.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarities**: The current situation mirrors historical tensions with military exercises and diplomatic standoffs.
    - **Differences**: Increased military exercises and cyber-attacks are more pronounced now. The U.S. has also shown stronger support for Taiwan, which could deter aggression.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **Increased Military Exercises**: The likelihood of these exercises if an invasion is planned (P(E | H)) is higher than if not (P(E | ~H)), suggesting a likelihood ratio >1, increasing the probability.
    - **U.S. Defense Commitments**: These commitments are more likely if no invasion is planned, suggesting a likelihood ratio <1, decreasing the probability.
    - **Cyber-attacks on Taiwan**: These attacks are more likely if hostilities are rising, suggesting a likelihood ratio >1, slightly increasing the probability.
    - **Economic Interdependence**: High economic costs are more likely to deter an invasion, suggesting a likelihood ratio <1, decreasing the probability.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    - **Prior Probability**: 1-2% (0.01 to 0.02 in probability terms).
    - **Evidence Impact**: 
      - Increased military exercises and cyber-attacks slightly increase the probability.
      - U.S. defense commitments and economic interdependence decrease the probability.
      
    Given the mixed evidence, the net effect is a slight increase from the prior, but the probability remains low.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: The historical non-invasion pattern is strong, but current tensions are higher than usual.
    - **Tail Risks**: Unexpected geopolitical shifts or internal Chinese politics could alter the situation.
    - **Alternative Forecast**: A more aggressive stance by China could increase the probability, but current deterrents are significant.
    
    ### 6. Final Forecast
    Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential tail risks, the probability of China invading Taiwan in 2025 remains low but slightly higher than the historical base rate due to current tensions.
    
    Final: 3%
