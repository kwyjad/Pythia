### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Genetic Genealogy Identifications in Cold Cases:** The most relevant class is the success rate of forensic genetic genealogy in identifying unknown persons, which is then confirmed by official analysis of the remains. This technique has a very high confirmation rate, often cited as over 95%, once a viable genealogical tree is constructed. The primary failure point is not the methodology but the inability to build a tree or find close matches. In this case, a specific identification (Carl Webb) was made.
    *   *Base Rate (Confirmation):* ~95% that the genetic genealogy ID is correct. This implies a ~5% chance the Somerton Man is *not* Carl Webb.
2.  **Long-Held Romantic/Familial Theories in Cold Cases:** Many cold cases attract compelling theories based on circumstantial evidence. When DNA technology becomes available, these theories are tested. Anecdotally, a large majority of these specific, long-held, non-DNA-based theories are proven false.
    *   *Base Rate (Confirmation):* ~10-20% that the original circumstantial theory (a link to Jestyn) is correct in the face of contradictory evidence.
3.  **Successful DNA Extraction from Old, Embalmed Remains:** The viability of the official test depends on extracting a usable DNA profile from remains exhumed after 70+ years. While challenging, modern techniques have improved significantly. Reports from 2021 described the remains as being in "reasonable condition."
    *   *Base Rate (Success):* ~70-90% chance of obtaining a usable DNA profile for comparison. Failure would likely lead to an ambiguous or negative resolution.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The question's horizon is very short (to Dec 31, 2025). The most critical developments occurred in 2021-2022, fundamentally reframing the problem from "Is it Jestyn's relative?" to "Is it Carl Webb?".

*   [2025-02-19] Smithsonian article reiterates that South Australia (SA) Police have not officially confirmed the Carl Webb identification. (↓) — Matters because it highlights the prolonged official silence (>3.5 years post-exhumation), increasing the probability of no positive confirmation before the 2025 deadline, which would trigger a negative resolution.
*   [2022-08-04] A media report explicitly states that the genetic genealogy findings identifying Carl Webb have *disproven* the theory that researcher Derek Abbott's wife, Rachel Egan (Jestyn's granddaughter), was related to the Somerton Man. (↓↓↓) — This is the most direct and powerful piece of evidence against a "YES" resolution, coming from the research that produced the Webb ID.
*   [2022-07-26] Researchers Derek Abbott and Colleen Fitzpatrick announce they have identified the Somerton Man as Carl “Charles” Webb using DNA from hairs in the death mask. (↓↓) — This provides a specific, verifiable, and alternative identity for the Somerton Man that has no known connection to the Thomson family, making the original theory highly improbable.
*   [2021-05-19] The Somerton Man's remains are exhumed by SA Police for official DNA analysis. (↑) — This action created the possibility of an official resolution, which is a prerequisite for a "YES" outcome.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Credibility of Genetic Genealogy:** The identification of Carl Webb by Abbott and Fitzpatrick using established genetic genealogy methods is the primary driver. If their work is accurate, the Somerton Man is not a direct ancestor of the Thomson line. (Large impact)
2.  **Official Confirmation Process:** The resolution hinges entirely on an official announcement from Forensic Science SA or a similar body. Their process, rigor, and potential for inconclusive results are central. A failure to extract a viable DNA profile from the exhumed remains would prevent a "YES" resolution. (Large impact)
3.  **Bureaucratic Inertia & Timeline:** With a hard deadline of Dec 31, 2025, any procedural or bureaucratic delays in the official investigation directly increase the probability of a negative resolution. The long silence since the 2021 exhumation is significant. (Moderate impact)
4.  **Contamination of the Hair Sample:** The main counter-argument is that the hairs in the death mask used by Abbott were not from the Somerton Man. While possible, this is a low-probability scenario compared to the robustness of the primary evidence. (Small impact)
5.  **Unknown Webb-Thomson Link:** A remote possibility exists that Carl Webb *is* related to the Thomson family through an unknown adoption or other non-obvious family connection. This would reconcile the two main threads of evidence. (Small impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Dueling Evidence Sources:** Unlike a typical cold case where DNA provides the first real lead, this case has strong circumstantial evidence for one theory (Thomson link) being directly contradicted by strong genetic evidence for another (Webb ID).
*   **Researcher's Personal Connection:** A lead researcher, Derek Abbott, is married to Rachel Egan, the granddaughter of "Jestyn." His own research has produced the evidence that *disproves* his wife's potential link to the man, lending significant credibility to the finding's objectivity.
*   **Prolonged Official Silence:** The >4-year gap between the exhumation and the current date (as of Oct 2025) without an official result is unusually long, suggesting potential difficulties, inconclusive findings, or a low-priority investigation.
*   **Hard Resolution Deadline:** The question's outcome is tied to a specific date. This makes the *timing* of an official announcement as important as the scientific result itself.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the pre-2021 circumstantial evidence (Jestyn's reaction, the book, shared physical traits), a forecaster might have held a prior of ~30% for a familial match (equivalent n≈10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓↓) The highly credible genetic genealogy identification of the man as Carl Webb, an individual with no known link to the Thomson family.
    *   (↓↓) The explicit statement from the researchers that their findings disprove the link to Rachel Egan.
    *   (↓) The prolonged silence from the official investigation, which increases the likelihood of the question timing out and resolving negative.
    *   (↑, small) The initiation of an official DNA test via exhumation, which at least created a pathway for a positive resolution.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence provides an extremely strong update away from the initial hypothesis. The posterior probability of a "YES" resolution should be very low, primarily reflecting the small chance of a major error in the Webb identification (e.g., sample contamination) or a surprise link between the Webb and Thomson families.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any official statement from SA Police or Forensic Science SA casting doubt on the Carl Webb identification.
    *   Reports of contamination issues with the death mask hair samples used by Abbott/Fitzpatrick.
    *   Genealogical discoveries unexpectedly linking the Webb family tree to the Thomson family tree.
    *   Any announcement of an impending press conference by SA Police regarding the Somerton Man case.

*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Official confirmation by SA Police of the Carl Webb identification.
    *   Leaks from the investigation corroborating the Webb ID.
    *   Statements from officials indicating the DNA from the exhumed remains was inconclusive or too degraded.
    *   The passing of the December 31, 2025 deadline with no announcement.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution by Timeout:** The question resolves negatively if no confirmation is made by Dec 31, 2025. The official investigation could be slow, and the truth might be "yes," but if it's not announced in time, the resolution will be "no."
*   **Official vs. Unofficial Findings:** The resolution depends *only* on the official finding. While Abbott's research is scientifically robust and likely correct, it does not resolve the question. A failure in the official lab process would lead to a negative resolution, irrespective of Abbott's work.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** SA Police and Forensic Science SA hold all the key information. The public analysis is based on the 2022 unofficial findings and the subsequent official silence.
*   **Complexity of "Related":** The resolution criteria are broad ("related"). This could theoretically be satisfied by a more distant relationship than grandfather, though this is not the primary hypothesis.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability of an official DNA match with Jestyn's family is extremely low. Strong genetic genealogy evidence identified the man as Carl Webb in 2022, a finding that directly refutes the long-held Thomson family theory, and the prolonged silence from the official investigation makes a contradictory announcement before the 2025 deadline highly improbable.

To forecast the probability that the Somerton Man's DNA will match that of "Jestyn's" family, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate for Genetic Genealogy Identifications:** The success rate of forensic genetic genealogy in identifying unknown persons is over 95% once a viable genealogical tree is constructed. However, this base rate is more relevant to confirming the identity of Carl Webb rather than a match to Jestyn's family.
- **Base Rate for Long-Held Theories:** Anecdotally, a large majority of specific, long-held, non-DNA-based theories are proven false when DNA technology becomes available. This suggests a base rate of 10-20% for the original circumstantial theory (a link to Jestyn) being correct.
- **Chosen Base Rate:** Given the strong genetic evidence identifying the Somerton Man as Carl Webb, and the explicit statement that this finding disproves the link to Jestyn, a lower base rate of around 10% is appropriate for a familial match to Jestyn's family.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The situation is similar to other cold cases where DNA evidence has been used to test long-held theories.
- **Difference:** The strong genetic evidence identifying Carl Webb as the Somerton Man directly contradicts the theory of a familial link to Jestyn, making this case unusual.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Genetic Genealogy Identification of Carl Webb (↓↓↓):** The identification of Carl Webb using genetic genealogy is highly credible and directly contradicts the Jestyn link. This evidence significantly decreases the probability of a match.
- **Explicit Disproof Statement (↓↓↓):** Researchers have stated that their findings disprove the link to Rachel Egan, Jestyn's granddaughter. This further decreases the probability.
- **Prolonged Official Silence (↓):** The lack of official confirmation over several years suggests difficulties or inconclusive findings, decreasing the likelihood of a positive match.
- **Exhumation for DNA Testing (↑, small):** The exhumation created a pathway for a positive resolution, but the lack of results so far limits its impact.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Probability:** 10% based on the base rate for long-held theories.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** The strong genetic evidence and explicit disproof statements provide a likelihood ratio significantly less than 1, reducing the probability.
- **Posterior Probability Calculation:**
  - Prior odds = 0.1 / 0.9 = 0.111
  - Likelihood ratio (qualitatively very low due to strong disproof evidence) = 0.01
  - Posterior odds = 0.111 × 0.01 = 0.00111
  - Posterior probability = 0.00111 / (1 + 0.00111) ≈ 0.0011 or 0.11%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of unknown connections or errors in the genetic analysis. However, these are low-probability scenarios given the robustness of the evidence.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative is a surprise genealogical link, but this is unlikely given the current evidence.
- **Adjustment:** The probability remains low, but to account for unforeseen factors, a slight increase to around 1% is reasonable.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the strong disproof evidence and the prolonged official silence, the probability of a DNA match to Jestyn's family is extremely low.

Final: 1%

# Will the Somerton Man's DNA match that of "Jestyn's" family?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability that the Somerton Man is related to Jestyn's family. The most appropriate reference class is the likelihood that a mysterious unidentified person is related to someone who had a suspicious reaction to their image and whose child shares unusual physical characteristics with them.

Given the circumstantial evidence before DNA analysis:
- Jestyn's strong reaction (near fainting) when shown the Somerton Man's bust
- The physical similarities between Robin Thomson and the Somerton Man (ear shape and hypodontia)
- The geographical proximity (Jestyn lived 400m from where the body was found)
- The connection through the book with "Jestyn" written in it

A reasonable prior probability would be around 30% that they are related. This reflects that while there is suggestive circumstantial evidence, most mysterious connections in cold cases turn out to be coincidental rather than familial.

**Prior probability: 30%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a cold case with circumstantial evidence suggesting a connection
- Physical similarities between individuals that could indicate genetic relationship
- Suspicious behavior by a key witness (Jestyn's reaction)

**Differences from base case:**
- The case has now had significant developments since the prior was established
- Genetic genealogy research has identified the Somerton Man as Carl Webb
- This identification directly contradicts the hypothesis of relation to Jestyn's family
- The official investigation has been ongoing for years without confirmation
- The question has a hard deadline (Dec 31, 2025) for resolution

These differences significantly alter the probability, as we now have strong evidence against the original hypothesis.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Identification of Somerton Man as Carl Webb by researchers**
- P(E|H): Probability of Webb identification if related to Jestyn = Very low (~0.05)
- P(E|~H): Probability of Webb identification if not related to Jestyn = High (~0.95)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability of relation

**Evidence 2: Researchers explicitly state their findings disprove the link to Rachel Egan**
- P(E|H): Probability of this statement if related = Very low (~0.01)
- P(E|~H): Probability of this statement if not related = Very high (~0.99)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.01/0.99 = 0.01
- This evidence dramatically decreases the probability of relation

**Evidence 3: Prolonged silence from official investigation (>4 years since exhumation)**
- P(E|H): Probability of silence if related = Low (~0.2)
- P(E|~H): Probability of silence if not related = Moderate (~0.6)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.6 = 0.33
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability of relation

**Evidence 4: Initiation of official DNA testing via exhumation**
- P(E|H): Probability of exhumation if related = High (~0.9)
- P(E|~H): Probability of exhumation if not related = High (~0.8)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.8 = 1.125
- This evidence slightly increases the probability of relation

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 30:70 (0.43:1)

Update with Evidence 1 (Webb identification):
- Posterior odds = 0.43 × 0.053 = 0.023
- Posterior probability = 0.023/(1+0.023) = 0.022 or 2.2%

Update with Evidence 2 (explicit statement disproving link):
- Posterior odds = 0.022 × 0.01 = 0.00022
- Posterior probability = 0.00022/(1+0.00022) = 0.00022 or 0.022%

Update with Evidence 3 (prolonged silence):
- Posterior odds = 0.00022 × 0.33 = 0.000073
- Posterior probability = 0.000073/(1+0.000073) = 0.000073 or 0.0073%

Update with Evidence 4 (exhumation for testing):
- Posterior odds = 0.000073 × 1.125 = 0.000082
- Posterior probability = 0.000082/(1+0.000082) = 0.000082 or 0.0082%

This extremely low probability reflects the overwhelming evidence against a familial connection.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Sample contamination or misidentification**: The hair samples used to identify Webb could have been contaminated or not from the Somerton Man. This would increase the probability.

2. **Unknown family connections**: Carl Webb could be related to the Thomson family through an unknown path, reconciling both theories.

3. **Official investigation findings**: The official investigation might have found something contradicting the Webb identification that hasn't been made public.

4. **Overconfidence in genetic genealogy**: While the technique is reliable, it's not infallible, especially with degraded samples.

5. **Resolution criteria specifics**: The question resolves positively if authorities say a relation is "over 50% likely" - a lower bar than absolute confirmation.

Considering these factors, I should adjust my probability upward from the extremely low 0.0082%. A more reasonable estimate accounting for these uncertainties would be around 1-2%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the strong evidence against a familial connection (Webb identification), the explicit statements from researchers that their findings disprove the link to Jestyn's family, and the prolonged silence from official investigators, the probability is very low. However, accounting for potential errors in the genetic genealogy process and the possibility of unknown connections, I'll set my final probability at 1%.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the success rate of long-held, compelling, but circumstantial theories in cold cases when they are finally subjected to DNA testing. Anecdotally, while these theories capture public imagination, the vast majority are disproven by definitive genetic evidence. A generous base rate for such a theory being correct might be around 20%. This acknowledges the non-random circumstantial evidence (the phone number, proximity, physical traits) that made the theory plausible in the first place, while reflecting the high rate at which such narratives are ultimately falsified.

*   **Prior Probability P(H):** 20% (where H is "The Somerton Man's DNA matches Jestyn's family")
*   **Prior Odds:** 0.20 / 0.80 = 1:4

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
This case is similar to the base case in that it pits a decades-old circumstantial theory against modern genetic testing. However, it differs in two crucial ways that significantly impact the forecast:

1.  **A Strong, Specific Counter-Hypothesis Exists:** Unlike many cases where DNA simply returns "no match," here, genetic genealogy has produced a specific, named identification: Carl “Charles” Webb. This isn't just an absence of evidence for the Jestyn theory; it's powerful evidence for a completely different reality.
2.  **A Hard Deadline for Official Confirmation:** The question resolves negatively if no official confirmation is made by December 31, 2025. The official investigation has been silent for over four years since the 2021 exhumation, making resolution by timeout a very real and increasing possibility.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H = A match is confirmed. Let ~H = No match is confirmed.

*   **Evidence 1: Genetic Genealogy Identification as Carl Webb (July 2022).** Researchers Derek Abbott and Colleen Fitzpatrick identified the man as Carl Webb using DNA from hairs in the plaster death mask. Webb has no known connection to the Thomson ("Jestyn") family.
    *   **P(E1 | H):** The probability of getting a credible, specific ID as "Carl Webb" IF the man was actually related to Jestyn is extremely low. It would require a major error, like sample contamination, or a secret, unknown link between the Webb and Thomson families. This probability is very small, perhaps <2%.
    *   **P(E1 | ~H):** The probability of identifying him as some other person (like Carl Webb) IF he is not related to Jestyn is very high. This is exactly what we would expect to happen.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E1|H)/P(E1|~H)):** Very small (<< 1). This evidence strongly decreases the probability of H.

*   **Evidence 2: Prolonged Official Silence & Approaching Deadline.** The remains were exhumed in May 2021. It is now October 2025, with less than three months to the deadline.
    *   **P(E2 | H):** The probability of over four years of silence from authorities IF they had found a sensational match confirming the long-held Jestyn theory seems low. The only plausible reason for such a delay would be the result contradicting the public Webb ID, requiring extensive re-verification. Even so, a 4+ year delay is long.
    *   **P(E2 | ~H):** The probability of a long delay IF the results were negative or inconclusive (e.g., degraded DNA) is much higher. Bureaucratic inertia, deprioritization, or a non-sensational result (confirming the Webb ID) are all very plausible reasons for a slow or non-existent announcement.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E2|H)/P(E2|~H)):** Small (< 1). This evidence also decreases the probability of H, primarily by increasing the chance of a negative resolution by timeout.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with our prior odds of 1:4 (20% probability), we update with the evidence.

The identification of Carl Webb is the most powerful piece of evidence. The likelihood ratio is extremely small. If we estimate the chance of the Webb ID being wrong (or secretly compatible with the Jestyn theory) as, say, 5%, this single piece of evidence would move the probability from 20% down to the low single digits.

*   **Initial Step:** Prior of 20%.
*   **Update:** The Webb ID provides a strong, specific alternative. The odds of the Jestyn theory being true *given* the Webb ID is correct are minuscule. The main uncertainty shifts to "What is the probability the Webb ID is wrong?" Let's estimate this at 5% (due to potential hair contamination). If the Webb ID is wrong, we revert to our 20% prior. This gives a rough posterior of 5% * 20% = 1%.
*   **Further Update:** The prolonged official silence and the looming deadline further reduce this. If there's only a 1% chance the theory is correct, we must also factor in the chance that the slow-moving official process will actually produce a positive confirmation before the deadline. This is unlikely, further pushing the probability down.

The final probability must be very low, primarily representing the small chance that the Webb ID is a mistake AND the official test proves the Jestyn link AND it is announced in time.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest argument for a "YES" outcome is that the entire Carl Webb identification is based on potentially contaminated hairs from a 70-year-old plaster cast. The DNA from the exhumed skeleton is the gold standard. It is plausible that the official silence is because the skeleton's DNA *does* match Jestyn's family, creating a confusing contradiction with the publicly reported Webb ID that requires years to resolve.

However, this scenario requires several unlikely events to occur in sequence: the hair DNA being wrong, the circumstantial Jestyn theory being right, and the authorities choosing complete silence for over four years as their method of dealing with the contradiction. A more mundane explanation for the silence (e.g., inconclusive results, low priority) is far more probable.

Another path to "YES" is that Carl Webb *is* the Somerton Man, but he was also secretly related to the Thomson family (e.g., the father of Jestyn's son). This would reconcile all evidence but relies on pure speculation.

Considering these alternative scenarios, a forecast of 1% might be slightly too low. Acknowledging the possibility of a major error in the Webb ID or a secret family link suggests a slightly higher probability is warranted. A 2-3% chance seems to appropriately cover these tail risks.

### Final Forecast
The evidence overwhelmingly points towards a "NO" resolution. The credible identification of the Somerton Man as Carl Webb in 2022 provides a strong, evidence-based alternative to the long-held theory of a link to "Jestyn's" family. Furthermore, the complete silence from the official investigation since the 2021 exhumation, combined with the fast-approaching resolution deadline of December 31, 2025, makes a last-minute positive confirmation highly improbable. The remaining probability rests on the small chance that the Webb identification was a major error and that the official results will both contradict it and be announced in time.

Final: 2%
