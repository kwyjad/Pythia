### Reference class & base rates
- **US Antimicrobial Sales in Livestock (2015-2023):** Sales decreased by 37% from 2015 to 2023, with a 2% decrease from 2022 to 2023. Base rate suggests a declining trend.
- **Global Antibiotic Use in Agriculture:** Many countries show a decreasing trend in antibiotic use in livestock, aligning with global efforts to combat antibiotic resistance.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2023-12-15] ↓ — FDA report shows a 2% decrease in antimicrobial sales from 2022 to 2023, continuing a downward trend.
- [2023-06-01] ↓ — New FDA regulations on antibiotic use in livestock aim to further reduce unnecessary use.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Regulatory Pressure (large):** Stricter FDA regulations and global pressure to reduce antibiotic use.
- **Public Health Concerns (moderate):** Growing awareness of antibiotic resistance drives policy and consumer behavior.
- **Industry Practices (moderate):** Shift towards alternative practices and technologies in livestock management.
- **Market Demand (small):** Consumer demand for antibiotic-free products influences industry practices.
- **Economic Factors (small):** Cost considerations may affect the adoption of alternative practices.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Regulatory Environment:** Recent FDA regulations are more stringent compared to previous years.
- **Public Awareness:** Increased public awareness and advocacy against antibiotic use in livestock.
- **Technological Advances:** More alternatives to antibiotics are available now than in previous years.
- **Market Dynamics:** Greater consumer demand for antibiotic-free products.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Declining trend in antimicrobial sales; equivalent n = moderate.
- **Evidence mapping:**
  - ↓ Large — Recent FDA regulations and global trends.
  - ↓ Moderate — Continued public health advocacy.
  - ↓ Small — Technological advances in livestock management.
- **Net effect:** Posterior should move down moderately, reinforcing the declining trend.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
  - Increase in livestock production requiring more antibiotics.
  - Relaxation of FDA regulations.
  - Surge in disease outbreaks in livestock.
- **DOWN indicators:**
  - New FDA reports showing further decreases.
  - Adoption of new technologies reducing antibiotic need.
  - Continued public campaigns against antibiotic use.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Data Gaps:** Incomplete or delayed data from FDA reports.
- **Regime Changes:** Potential changes in regulatory policies.
- **Definitional Gotchas:** Variability in defining "medically important" antimicrobials.
- **Market Fluctuations:** Economic shifts affecting livestock production.

Final Research Summary: The declining trend in antimicrobial sales for livestock is likely to continue into 2024, driven by regulatory pressures and public health concerns. The probability of a ≥0.5% increase in sales is low, given current evidence.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for this event is derived from the historical trend of antimicrobial sales in livestock. From 2015 to 2023, there was a 37% decrease, with a 2% decrease from 2022 to 2023. This suggests a consistent downward trend. Therefore, the base rate for an increase of at least 0.5% in 2024 is low. I will start with a prior probability of 20%, reflecting the persistent decline.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The ongoing regulatory pressure and public health concerns are consistent with the historical context of decreasing antimicrobial sales.
       - Differences: The recent FDA regulations are more stringent, and there is increased public awareness and technological alternatives, which further support the declining trend.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - **Regulatory Pressure:** The likelihood of a decrease given new regulations is high (P(E | ~H) > P(E | H)). This evidence decreases the probability of an increase.
       - **Public Health Concerns:** Continued advocacy against antibiotic use makes a decrease more likely (P(E | ~H) > P(E | H)). This evidence also decreases the probability.
       - **Technological Advances:** Availability of alternatives to antibiotics supports a decrease (P(E | ~H) > P(E | H)). This evidence decreases the probability.
       - **Market Demand:** Consumer demand for antibiotic-free products suggests a decrease (P(E | ~H) > P(E | H)). This evidence decreases the probability.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds = 20% / 80% = 0.25
       - Likelihood ratio for all evidence combined suggests a strong decrease (e.g., 0.1).
       - Posterior odds = 0.25 × 0.1 = 0.025
       - Posterior probability = 0.025 / (1 + 0.025) ≈ 2.44%
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence could arise from underestimating potential increases in livestock production or disease outbreaks that might necessitate more antibiotic use.
       - An alternative forecast might consider a scenario where economic factors or a relaxation of regulations lead to increased sales. However, current evidence strongly supports a continued decline.
       - Adjusting for these considerations, I might slightly increase the probability to account for unforeseen factors, but the impact remains minimal.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the probability of antimicrobial drug sales for livestock increasing by at least 0.5% in 2024 is low.
    
    Final: 5%
