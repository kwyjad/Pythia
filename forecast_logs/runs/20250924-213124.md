  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast whether housing prices in Madrid will rise by more than 18% in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for housing price increases of more than 18% in a single year is relatively low, given historical data on real estate markets. While 2024 saw a 20% increase, such high growth rates are not typical year-over-year. A reasonable base rate might be around 10%, reflecting the rarity of such large increases in stable markets.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The Madrid real estate market is currently characterized by strong demand and tight supply, which can drive prices up. The previous year saw a 20% increase, indicating a strong upward trend.
       - Differences: The forecast from Caixabank Research suggests a more modest increase of 6%-7% for Spain overall, which might imply a cooling off from the previous year's growth rate. Additionally, macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and economic growth could influence the market differently in 2025.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - **Strong Demand and Tight Supply**: This evidence supports the possibility of a significant price increase. If prices rise by more than 18%, strong demand and tight supply are likely (P(E | H) is high). If prices do not rise by more than 18%, this scenario is less likely (P(E | ~H) is lower). This evidence increases the probability.
       - **Caixabank Forecast**: A forecast of 6%-7% for Spain suggests a lower likelihood of an 18%+ increase in Madrid. If prices rise by more than 18%, this forecast is less likely (P(E | H) is lower). If prices do not rise by more than 18%, this forecast is more likely (P(E | ~H) is higher). This evidence decreases the probability.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds = 0.1 / 0.9 = 0.111
       - Likelihood ratio for strong demand and tight supply = 2 (qualitative estimate)
       - Likelihood ratio for Caixabank forecast = 0.3 (qualitative estimate)
       - Combined likelihood ratio = 2 * 0.3 = 0.6
       - Posterior odds = 0.111 * 0.6 = 0.0666
       - Posterior probability = 0.0666 / (1 + 0.0666) ≈ 0.0625 or 6.25%
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence could arise from underestimating the potential for continued strong demand or unexpected economic stimuli. Conversely, risks such as economic downturns or policy changes could further dampen growth.
       - An alternative forecast might consider a scenario where Madrid's market significantly outperforms the national average due to localized factors, but this seems less likely given the evidence.
       - Adjusting for these considerations, the probability might be slightly higher, but still below the base rate.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final probability is adjusted to reflect a slightly higher chance than the posterior calculation, accounting for uncertainties and potential market dynamics.
