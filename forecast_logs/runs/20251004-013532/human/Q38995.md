### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major, controversial federal social policy changes via legislation.** This class includes attempts to pass significant legislation on topics like gun control, immigration, or healthcare reform. The base rate of success within a single two-year congressional term is low, likely **5-10%**. This is due to institutional hurdles like the Senate filibuster, narrow majorities, and intense political opposition.
2.  **Successful legal or administrative challenges overturning a long-standing FDA drug approval.** This is an extremely rare event. The FDA is typically granted significant deference by courts (*Chevron* deference, although its future is debated), and the process for administratively withdrawing a drug is lengthy and evidence-based. The base rate for a politically motivated reversal that withstands immediate legal challenge is very low, likely **<1%**.
3.  **Sweeping executive actions on contentious issues surviving immediate, nationwide legal challenge.** Administrations often use executive orders to enact policy, but these are frequently met with lawsuits and preliminary injunctions, especially when they reverse prior policy or affect state interests. The base rate for such an action taking full, nationwide effect without being stayed by any court within its first year is low, perhaps **10-15%**. The "in every state" clause of the resolution makes this an even higher bar.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2024-06-13] SCOTUS rules plaintiffs lack standing in *Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine (AHM) v. FDA*. ↓ — Eliminated the most immediate judicial threat to mifepristone access, returning the situation to the status quo. The ruling was on procedural grounds, not the merits.
*   [2025-01-20] New presidential administration and Congress are sworn in. ↑ — (Assumed for analysis) A Republican-controlled government is the primary prerequisite for a federal ban, making this a significant shift in the political landscape enabling potential action.
*   [2025-05-02] States (e.g., Missouri, Kansas, Idaho) file to intervene in the remanded *AHM* case. ↑ — This action keeps the primary legal challenge alive by substituting plaintiffs who may have stronger claims to legal standing, restarting the judicial threat.
*   [2025-09-15] District Court Judge Kacsmaryk grants the states' motion to intervene in the *AHM* case. ↑ — This procedural step confirms the legal challenge will proceed with more legally robust plaintiffs, increasing the probability of a ruling on the merits against the FDA.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Executive Action (Large):** A new administration could direct the Department of Justice (DOJ) to enforce the Comstock Act of 1873 to prohibit mailing mifepristone, or direct the FDA to administratively withdraw its approval. This is the fastest potential mechanism, but is highly vulnerable to legal challenge.
2.  **Judicial Rulings (Large):** The ongoing *AHM* case, now with states as plaintiffs, could result in a district or appellate court ruling that restricts mifepristone. The key variable is whether such a ruling would be stayed by the Supreme Court pending appeal.
3.  **Federal Legislation (Moderate):** Congress could pass a law banning or restricting mifepristone. This is difficult due to the Senate filibuster, but could be attached as a rider to a must-pass government funding bill.
4.  **State-Level Legal Resistance (Large, counteracting):** Pro-choice states (e.g., California, New York) would immediately sue to block any federal ban or restriction. Their success in obtaining a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction in even one federal circuit would prevent the resolution criteria ("in every state") from being met.
5.  **Political Will & Priorities (Moderate):** Even with unified control, the governing party must prioritize this issue over others (e.g., economy, immigration). Internal divisions or fear of political backlash could delay or scuttle action.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extremely High Resolution Bar:** The requirement for the restriction to be effective "in every state" is a crucial difference. Base rates for policy implementation rarely face this stringent, nationwide-and-without-exception standard. A single successful state-level injunction would resolve this question "No."
*   **Post-Dobbs Judicial Environment:** Unlike historical challenges to FDA authority, the current judiciary, particularly in specific circuits like the Fifth, has shown more willingness to scrutinize and overturn administrative agency actions, especially on ideologically charged issues.
*   **Resurrection of Dormant Law:** The potential use of the Comstock Act is a novel legal strategy not present in typical regulatory challenges. It attempts to bypass the standard FDA regulatory framework entirely.
*   **Unprecedented Political Salience:** The issue of abortion access, and mifepristone specifically, is at the forefront of national political debate, creating a much stronger political will to act than for typical FDA-approved drugs.
*   **Very Short Time Horizon:** With the question resolving at the start of 2026, there is less than 15 months from the start of a new administration (Jan 2025) for any legislative, executive, or judicial action to be implemented and overcome the inevitable, time-consuming legal challenges.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (e.g., 5-10% with an equivalent n=20) based on the reference classes of overturning FDA approvals and enacting major, controversial policy that survives immediate nationwide legal challenge.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓ (Large): The "in every state" resolution criteria creates an extremely high bar, making a single state-level injunction a fatal blow to a "Yes" outcome.
    *   ↓ (Large): The short time horizon (<15 months) is insufficient for the slow process of litigation and appeals to conclude, or for overcoming legislative hurdles, making the status quo highly favored.
    *   ↑ (Large): A unified Republican government (assumed post-2024 election) provides the political opportunity and will to attempt a ban, a necessary precondition.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The re-emergence of the *AHM* lawsuit with states as plaintiffs creates a viable, if slow, judicial pathway for a ban.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The certainty of immediate and well-funded legal opposition from blue states and civil rights groups makes a preliminary injunction highly probable.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces a "No" resolution. The immense procedural and legal hurdles, magnified by the "in every state" clause and the short timeline, far outweigh the political will to enact a ban. The posterior should move significantly down from an already low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   The DOJ under a new administration issues a formal opinion reinterpreting the Comstock Act to apply to mifepristone.
    *   A Republican-controlled Senate changes filibuster rules or successfully attaches a mifepristone-restricting rider to a must-pass bill.
    *   The Supreme Court signals a retreat from agency deference in a separate case.
    *   The Fifth Circuit or Supreme Court declines to stay a lower court injunction against mifepristone.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A federal court in a blue state (e.g., 9th Circuit) issues a preemptive injunction protecting mifepristone access in that state.
    *   Key moderate Republican senators publicly state they will not vote to restrict mifepristone.
    *   The FDA takes new administrative steps to further solidify the drug's approval status.
    *   The *AHM* case with state plaintiffs is dismissed for other procedural reasons or delayed past the resolution date.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Criteria Nuance:** The "in every state" clause is the single most important factor. Forecasters must not mistake a partial ban or a ban affecting only certain states for a "Yes" resolution.
*   **Action vs. Effect:** An executive order or a court ruling might be issued, but if it is immediately stayed by another court, it is not in effect. The resolution depends on the *de facto* legal status of prescribing the drug.
*   **"Significantly restricted" Ambiguity:** While defined as preventing termination for a majority of 6-week pregnancies, this could be subject to interpretation. However, the likely restriction scenarios (e.g., reverting to pre-2016 rules) would likely meet this bar if implemented.
*   **Political Assumption:** This analysis is heavily contingent on a post-2024 election result that empowers Republicans to act. If Democrats retain the Presidency or a chamber of Congress, the probability of a "Yes" resolution falls to near-zero.
*   **Black Swan Judicial Action:** The Supreme Court could take up a case on an emergency basis (the "shadow docket") and issue a ruling with immediate nationwide effect, though this would be an extraordinary and unlikely procedural move against the status quo.

### Final Research Summary
The probability of mifepristone becoming illegal or significantly restricted in every US state before 2026 is very low. The primary barriers are the extremely high bar of the resolution criteria ("in

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for major, controversial federal social policy changes via legislation is 5-10%. This is due to the significant institutional hurdles such as the Senate filibuster and intense political opposition. Additionally, the base rate for successful legal or administrative challenges overturning a long-standing FDA drug approval is extremely low, likely <1%. Given these factors, a reasonable prior probability for mifepristone becoming significantly restricted or illegal is around 5%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves a controversial policy change with significant political and legal hurdles, similar to the base case of major federal social policy changes.
   - Differences: The requirement for the restriction to be effective "in every state" is a crucial difference, making the bar for resolution much higher than typical policy changes.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Unified Republican Government (↑):** Increases the probability as it provides the political opportunity to attempt a ban. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **AHM Lawsuit with States as Plaintiffs (↑):** Increases the probability as it creates a viable judicial pathway for a ban. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **"In Every State" Clause (↓):** Decreases the probability significantly as a single state-level injunction would prevent a "Yes" resolution. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - **Short Time Horizon (↓):** Decreases the probability as the time available is insufficient for overcoming legal and legislative hurdles. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - **State-Level Legal Resistance (↓):** Decreases the probability as pro-choice states are likely to obtain injunctions. Likelihood ratio < 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 5% / 95% = 0.0526
   - Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratios for the positive evidence (unified government, AHM lawsuit) are outweighed by the negative evidence (in every state clause, short time horizon, state-level resistance).
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × (Likelihood ratio for positive evidence / Likelihood ratio for negative evidence)
   - Given the strong negative evidence, the posterior probability remains low, likely around 3-4%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could arise from underestimating the potential for rapid judicial or executive action. However, the "in every state" clause and short time horizon are significant barriers.
   - An alternative forecast might consider a higher probability if there were signs of rapid judicial decisions favoring restrictions or changes in Senate rules. However, these scenarios remain unlikely given current evidence.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and red team thinking, the final forecast is a low probability of mifepristone becoming significantly restricted or illegal across the US before 2026.

Final: 4%

# Will mifepristone become significantly restricted or illegal to prescribe for abortions across the US before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for a medication becoming significantly restricted or illegal nationwide after being FDA-approved for over 20 years.

The most relevant reference classes are:
- FDA-approved drugs that were later significantly restricted or withdrawn
- Major nationwide policy changes on contentious social issues that occur within a short timeframe (15 months)
- Legal challenges that successfully overturn FDA approvals

Looking at historical data:
- FDA drug withdrawals are rare, especially for political rather than safety reasons
- Major nationwide policy changes on contentious issues typically take years, not months
- Courts have historically granted significant deference to FDA decisions

Given these considerations, I'll set a prior of **7%**. This reflects:
- The extreme rarity of FDA-approved drugs becoming illegal nationwide
- The high bar of the resolution criteria requiring restrictions "in every state"
- The short timeframe (less than 15 months remaining until resolution)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Mifepristone has FDA approval and established safety record (approved since 2000)
- Legal challenges to FDA-approved drugs typically face significant hurdles
- Nationwide policy changes on contentious issues face institutional resistance

**Key differences:**
- Abortion is uniquely politically polarized compared to most FDA drug approvals
- The Supreme Court's Dobbs decision created a new legal landscape for abortion-related issues
- The "in every state" requirement creates an extremely high bar for resolution
- The short timeframe (until January 2026) limits the mechanisms that could realistically succeed

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Supreme Court's June 2024 ruling in AHM v. FDA**
- The Court ruled plaintiffs lacked standing but did not address the merits
- P(E|H) = 0.7 (If mifepristone will be restricted, we'd expect early legal challenges)
- P(E|~H) = 0.9 (If mifepristone won't be restricted, we'd very likely see early challenges fail)
- Likelihood ratio = 0.7/0.9 = 0.78 (slightly decreases probability)

**Evidence 2: States filing to intervene in remanded AHM case**
- New plaintiffs with potentially stronger standing claims keep the case alive
- P(E|H) = 0.9 (If restriction will happen, we'd expect persistent legal challenges)
- P(E|~H) = 0.7 (Even if restriction won't happen, legal challenges would likely continue)
- Likelihood ratio = 0.9/0.7 = 1.29 (slightly increases probability)

**Evidence 3: "In every state" resolution requirement**
- Even one successful state-level injunction would prevent resolution as "Yes"
- P(E|H) = 0.2 (If nationwide restriction will occur, the resolution criteria would be very difficult)
- P(E|~H) = 0.9 (If no nationwide restriction, the resolution criteria would naturally not be met)
- Likelihood ratio = 0.2/0.9 = 0.22 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 4: Short timeframe until resolution (January 2026)**
- Legal challenges typically take years to resolve through appeals
- P(E|H) = 0.3 (If restriction will happen, it would need to occur unusually quickly)
- P(E|~H) = 0.8 (If no restriction, the normal slow pace of legal proceedings would explain it)
- Likelihood ratio = 0.3/0.8 = 0.38 (significantly decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 7% (odds of 7:93 or about 1:13.3):

**Update on Evidence 3 (resolution criteria):**
- Prior odds = 0.07/0.93 = 0.075
- Likelihood ratio = 0.22
- Posterior odds = 0.075 × 0.22 = 0.0165
- Posterior probability = 0.0165/(1 + 0.0165) = 0.016 or 1.6%

**Update on Evidence 4 (timeframe):**
- Prior odds = 0.016/0.984 = 0.0163
- Likelihood ratio = 0.38
- Posterior odds = 0.0163 × 0.38 = 0.0062
- Posterior probability = 0.0062/(1 + 0.0062) = 0.0062 or 0.62%

**Considering Evidence 1 and 2 together:**
- The combined effect is slightly negative (0.78 × 1.29 = 1.01)
- This has negligible impact on the posterior probability

After these updates, my posterior probability is approximately **0.6%**.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the speed at which a determined executive branch could act
- The Comstock Act revival strategy could bypass normal regulatory processes
- I might be overestimating the effectiveness of state-level legal resistance

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A new administration could direct the FDA to administratively withdraw approval through an expedited process
- The Supreme Court could use its "shadow docket" to issue an emergency ruling with immediate nationwide effect
- Congress could attach a mifepristone ban to must-pass legislation like a government funding bill

**Best alternative forecast:**
The strongest case for a higher probability (perhaps 10-15%) would emphasize:
1. The unprecedented political focus on abortion post-Dobbs
2. The potential for novel legal strategies like the Comstock Act
3. The possibility of coordinated action across all three branches of government

**Rebuttals:**
1. Even with coordinated action, the "in every state" requirement means a single successful state injunction would prevent resolution as "Yes"
2. The short timeframe severely limits the ability to overcome legal challenges
3. Historical precedent strongly favors the status quo for FDA-approved medications

After considering these factors, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for these scenarios, but the fundamental constraints remain.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and the red team analysis, I believe the probability of mifepristone becoming significantly restricted or illegal to prescribe for abortions across the US before 2026 is very low. The combination of the "in every state" requirement, the short timeframe, and the strong institutional barriers make this outcome highly unlikely.

Final: 2%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a major, controversial federal policy change that overturns a long-standing regulatory approval and must survive immediate, nationwide legal challenges to be effective. I will use a composite base rate derived from several reference classes:
- **Successful legal/administrative challenges overturning a long-standing FDA drug approval:** This is extremely rare. The base rate is very low, likely <1%. The FDA's scientific determinations are typically granted deference.
- **Major, controversial federal social policy changes via legislation:** Success within a short timeframe is low due to institutional hurdles like the Senate filibuster. The base rate is perhaps 5-10%.
- **Sweeping executive actions surviving immediate, nationwide legal challenge:** This is also uncommon. Such actions are almost always met with lawsuits and temporary injunctions, especially when they affect state interests. The requirement for the policy to be effective "in every state" makes this an even higher bar than for a typical executive action.

Combining these, a conservative and appropriate prior probability P(H) for such a policy being successfully implemented nationwide is very low. I will set the initial prior at **4%**. This acknowledges that an attempt is plausible under certain political conditions, but success is historically rare.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- The issue of abortion is highly polarized, fitting the "controversial social policy" reference class.
- The expected mechanism involves federal action (legislative, executive, or judicial) that would preempt the status quo.
- The expected reaction involves immediate and widespread litigation from opposing groups and states, which is typical for such policies.

**Differences:**
- **Extremely High Resolution Bar:** The most significant difference is the requirement that the restriction be effective **"in every state."** This is a crucial detail. A single successful preliminary injunction in any federal district court would prevent this condition from being met and resolve the question to "No." This makes the event far less likely than a typical policy change which could be partially implemented.
- **Extremely Short Time Horizon:** The current date is October 4, 2025, and the question resolves on January 1, 2026. This leaves less than three months. The US legislative and judicial systems are notoriously slow. Enacting a law or completing a cycle of judicial review (e.g., district court ruling -> circuit court stay decision -> Supreme Court stay decision) within this timeframe is extraordinarily difficult.
- **Specific Legal Pretext:** The potential use of the 19th-century Comstock Act or the ongoing *AHM v. FDA* case provides specific, pre-existing legal avenues for an attempt, which might accelerate the process compared to starting from scratch.

The differences, especially the high resolution bar and the short timeline, make a "Yes" outcome substantially less likely than the already low base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let's evaluate the key evidence, focusing on the current situation (October 2025).

- **E1: The remaining timeline is less than 3 months.** This is the most powerful piece of evidence.
    - P(E1 | H): The probability of having <3 months left, given that a nationwide ban *will* be successfully implemented. This is low. Complex, contested processes rarely conclude successfully at the last possible second.
    - P(E1 | ~H): The probability of having <3 months left, given a ban *will not* be successfully implemented. This is very high. The status quo is sticky; if failure is the outcome, it's very likely that the state of failure persists until the end.
    - **Likelihood Ratio (P(E1|H)/P(E1|~H)) is very small (<< 1).** This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

- **E2: The "in every state" resolution criterion.** This is a structural feature of the question.
    - P(E2 | H): By definition, this is 1.
    - P(E2 | ~H): The probability that a restriction would fail to be implemented in every state, given that it fails overall. This is very high, as a single injunction is the most likely failure mode.
    - The practical effect is that any attempt at a ban is almost certain to face a legal challenge that will succeed in at least one jurisdiction (e.g., the 9th Circuit), preventing the "in every state" condition from being met. This is another strong factor decreasing the probability.

- **E3: A viable judicial path exists (*AHM* case with state plaintiffs).** This case is proceeding before a sympathetic judge (Kacsmaryk).
    - This evidence increases the probability of an *attempt* and a favorable lower-court ruling.
    - However, it does not overcome the timeline and "in every state" hurdles. An injunction from Judge Kacsmaryk would be immediately appealed and a stay would be sought. Furthermore, it would likely conflict with rulings from other courts ordering the FDA to maintain access, creating a "dueling injunctions" scenario that would not result in a clear nationwide ban.
    - This evidence slightly increases the probability from near-zero, but its effect is muted by the other constraints.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's start with the **Prior of 4%** (odds of 4:96 or 1:24).

The most decisive piece of new information is the extremely short timeline. Let's consider the likelihood ratio for the timeline evidence. If a successful ban were to happen, it's much more likely it would have happened earlier in the year rather than being crammed into the final 12 weeks. Conversely, if the ban fails, it's extremely likely that it would still be in a state of failure with 12 weeks to go. A conservative likelihood ratio for this evidence might be 1/10.

- **Prior Odds:** 1:24
- **Likelihood Ratio (Timeline):** ~1:10
- **Posterior Odds:** (1 * 1) : (24 * 10) = 1:240

A posterior odds of 1:240 translates to a probability of 1 / (1 + 240) ≈ 0.4%.

This calculation shows the immense downward pressure from the timeline alone. The "in every state" criterion provides a second, independent, and equally strong downward pressure. The combined effect pushes the probability to a very low value.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest argument for a "Yes" outcome is a "black swan" judicial scenario. A motivated executive branch could use an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court (the "shadow docket") to seek a nationwide stay of any lower-court rulings that block their policy. The current Supreme Court has shown a willingness to use this mechanism for major decisions. If Judge Kacsmaryk issues a nationwide injunction, and the Supreme Court, in an emergency ruling, refuses to stay it, this could theoretically lead to a "Yes" resolution.

However, this path is fraught with peril. It requires the judicial process to move at an unprecedented speed. It also ignores the dueling injunctions problem, where a court in a blue state has previously ordered the FDA to preserve access. The Supreme Court would have to resolve this conflict, which is unlikely to happen on an emergency basis before January 1.

The Manifold market is at 8.3%. This is much higher than my estimate. This discrepancy could be due to (1) the market over-weighting the "black swan" judicial risk, (2) the market not fully internalizing the stringency of the "in every state" clause, or (3) the market forecast being stale and not reflecting the now-imminent deadline. Given the procedural realities, the market seems overly high. My analysis suggests the structural barriers (timeline, resolution criteria) are too formidable. I will adjust my probability slightly upward from the calculated <1% to account for the small tail risk of an extraordinary Supreme Court action, but I remain confident that the probability is very low.

### Final Forecast
The probability is extremely low. The combination of a very short timeline (less than three months) and the stringent resolution criterion that the restriction must be effective "in every state" creates an almost insurmountable barrier. While a judicial or executive attempt to restrict mifepristone remains possible, it is virtually certain to be immediately challenged in court. A single successful injunction in any of the 50 states would resolve this question as "No." The time available is insufficient for such a contested legal battle to conclude with a clear, nationwide victory for those seeking to restrict the drug. The small, residual probability accounts for the slim chance of a rapid and sweeping "shadow docket" ruling from the Supreme Court that overcomes all these obstacles.

Final: 3%
