### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical Election Results**: The New Democratic Party (NDP) won 24 seats in the 2021 federal election and 44 seats in 2019. Base rate range: 20-45 seats.
- **Third Party Performance**: Historically, third parties in Canada, like the NDP, have fluctuated between 10-50 seats depending on political climate and leadership.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-01-06] Trudeau resignation — ↑ — Liberal leadership change may shift votes to NDP.
- [2025-01-15] Conservative lead in polls — ↓ — Conservative dominance may reduce NDP seat potential.
- [2025-03-09] New Liberal leader — ↓ — Potential revitalization of Liberal support could draw votes from NDP.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Leadership Changes**: Moderate impact; new Liberal leader could attract centrist voters.
- **Conservative Surge**: Large impact; strong Conservative polling may overshadow NDP.
- **Economic Conditions**: Moderate impact; economic dissatisfaction could benefit NDP.
- **Policy Platforms**: Small impact; NDP's progressive policies may attract specific voter segments.
- **Voter Turnout**: Moderate impact; higher turnout among young/progressive voters could boost NDP.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Leadership Transition**: Uncertainty in Liberal leadership could temporarily benefit NDP.
- **Conservative Dominance**: Unusually strong Conservative lead may suppress NDP gains.
- **Electoral Map Changes**: New districts may alter traditional voting patterns.
- **Public Sentiment**: Current economic and social issues may favor NDP's platform more than in past cycles.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a prior centered around 30 seats with moderate confidence (equivalent n = 10).
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Trudeau resignation (small)
  - ↓ Conservative lead (large)
  - ↓ New Liberal leader (moderate)
  - ↑ Economic dissatisfaction (moderate)
- **Net effect**: Posterior should slightly decrease due to strong Conservative polling and potential Liberal revitalization.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Increased NDP visibility in media.
  - Rising economic dissatisfaction.
  - Strong NDP performance in by-elections.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Continued Conservative polling strength.
  - Successful Liberal leadership transition.
  - Decline in youth voter engagement.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Polling Volatility**: Polls may not accurately capture late shifts in voter sentiment.
- **Leadership Impact**: New Liberal leader's impact is uncertain.
- **Electoral Map Effects**: New districts may have unpredictable outcomes.
- **Voter Turnout**: Uncertainty in turnout rates, especially among young voters.
- **Media Influence**: Media narratives can rapidly shift public opinion.

Final Research Summary: The NDP's seat count in the 2025 election is likely to be influenced by Conservative dominance and Liberal leadership changes, with a slight downward adjustment from historical base rates. Watch for shifts in economic sentiment and voter turnout as key indicators.

## Per-model

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for the New Democratic Party (NDP) in Canadian federal elections is between 20-45 seats, based on historical results from recent elections (24 seats in 2021 and 44 seats in 2019). This range reflects typical third-party performance in Canada.
       - Mean/median: Approximately 30 seats. Variance: Moderate, reflecting historical fluctuations.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The NDP remains a third party in a political landscape dominated by the Liberal and Conservative parties.
       - Differences: The current political climate is marked by a strong Conservative lead and a leadership change in the Liberal Party, which could impact NDP's traditional voter base.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Trudeau's resignation and potential Liberal leadership change could temporarily benefit the NDP by attracting centrist voters (small positive impact).
       - The Conservative Party's strong polling lead is a significant negative factor, likely reducing NDP's seat potential (large negative impact).
       - Economic dissatisfaction could favor the NDP, as their platform may appeal to voters unhappy with the status quo (moderate positive impact).
       - The new electoral map introduces uncertainty but does not inherently favor the NDP (neutral impact).
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - Starting with a prior centered around 30 seats, the evidence suggests a slight downward adjustment.
       - The strong Conservative lead and potential Liberal revitalization outweigh the positive impacts of economic dissatisfaction and leadership uncertainty.
       - Posterior mean shifts slightly lower, with increased variance due to electoral map changes and leadership transitions.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The forecast could underestimate the impact of economic dissatisfaction or overestimate the Conservative lead's effect.
       - Alternative scenario: If the new Liberal leader fails to gain traction, the NDP could capture more centrist votes, increasing their seat count.
       - Adjustments: Consider a wider distribution to account for these uncertainties, particularly around the potential for increased NDP support if economic conditions worsen.
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Based on the analysis, the forecasted seat distribution for the NDP in the 2025 election is as follows:
    P10: 18
    P20: 22
    P40: 27
    P60: 32
    P80: 37
    P90: 42
