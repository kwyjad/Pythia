## Per-model

- **OpenRouter-Default** ok=True time=18891ms cost=$12.7675 parsed=0.05

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The base rate for interim U.S. Attorneys transitioning to confirmed roles is approximately 30%. However, given the unique circumstances surrounding Alina Habba's appointment, a more relevant base rate might be the 20% for acting U.S. Attorneys who remain in position for over a year. This reflects the challenges and instability often associated with acting roles.
       - Initial prior: 20% probability that Habba remains in her position by December 31, 2025.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: Like other acting U.S. Attorneys, Habba faces the challenge of securing a more permanent position amidst political and legal dynamics.
       - Differences: The legal challenges and court rulings against her appointment are more pronounced than typical cases, suggesting a higher likelihood of her not remaining in the position.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Legal ruling against her appointment: This is a strong indicator against her remaining in the position. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
       - Court appointment of a replacement: Further decreases the probability of her staying. Likelihood ratio less than 1.
       - Continued political support from Trump: Provides some support for her staying, but not enough to outweigh legal challenges. Likelihood ratio slightly more than 1.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
       - Prior odds = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25
       - Likelihood ratio (combined effect of evidence) is significantly less than 1 due to strong legal challenges.
       - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.25 × (much less than 1)
       - Posterior probability = (Posterior odds) / (1 + Posterior odds) = significantly less than 20%
       - Resulting posterior probability is much lower than the initial 20%, reflecting the strong legal and judicial challenges.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: The legal challenges are significant, but political dynamics can be unpredictable. Consider the possibility of a successful appeal or political maneuvering that could change the outcome.
       - Alternative forecast: If the legal ruling is overturned or delayed, her chances of remaining could increase. However, the current legal environment strongly suggests a low probability.
       - Adjustments: Given the strong legal challenges, the probability remains low, but it's important to remain open to new developments.
    
    6. **Final Forecast**
       - Considering the strong legal challenges and the court's appointment of a replacement, the probability of Alina Habba remaining as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey by December 31, 2025, is low.
       
    Final: 5%

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast the ending value of the UST 10Y Yield for the biweekly period from Sep 29 to Oct 10, we will follow the outlined steps:
    
    1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
       - The historical range for the 10-Year Treasury Yield from 2019 to 2025 is 0.5% to 4.5%. Given the post-COVID economic recovery and recent trends, a reasonable base rate is centered around 3.5%, reflecting the current economic conditions and market expectations.
       - Mean/Median: 3.5%, Variance: Moderate, reflecting typical fluctuations in economic conditions.
    
    2. **Comparison to Base Case**
       - Similarities: The current economic environment still reflects post-COVID recovery dynamics, with inflation and economic growth as key drivers.
       - Differences: Recent inflation data is higher than typical, and the Fed's dovish stance is unusual given the inflationary pressures, which could moderate yield increases.
    
    3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
       - Fed signals potential rate cuts: This would typically lower yields, but the impact is moderate due to inflation concerns.
       - Rising inflation data: Increases yield pressures, moderately strong evidence.
       - Strong job growth: Suggests economic resilience, providing slight upward pressure on yields.
    
    4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
       - Prior centered at 3.5%. 
       - Evidence suggests a slight upward adjustment due to inflation and job growth outweighing potential rate cuts.
       - Posterior mean shifts slightly upwards, with increased variance to account for economic uncertainty.
    
    5. **Red Team Thinking**
       - Overconfidence risk: Ensure not to overestimate the impact of inflation without considering potential Fed actions.
       - Tail risks: Geopolitical tensions and unexpected Fed policy changes could lead to significant deviations.
       - Alternative forecast: A scenario where the Fed aggressively cuts rates could lead to lower yields, but current evidence suggests this is less likely.
    
    6. **Final Percentiles**
       - Given the evidence and Bayesian update, the forecasted percentiles are adjusted to reflect a slight upward pressure on yields.
    
    P10: 3.4  
    P20: 3.5  
    P40: 3.6

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To produce a probabilistic forecast for the excess returns of Nasdaq-100 Futures over S&P 500 Futures for the period of September 29 to October 10, 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Base Rate**: Historically, the Nasdaq-100 has outperformed the S&P 500 by an average of 2-3 percentage points annually during tech-driven bull markets. Given the biweekly period, a reasonable base rate for excess returns might be around 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points, assuming a linear extrapolation.
    - **Variance**: The tech sector's higher volatility suggests a relatively wide spread. A standard deviation of 0.5 percentage points for biweekly excess returns seems reasonable based on historical volatility.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarities**: The current tech-driven optimism, particularly around AI advancements, aligns with past periods of Nasdaq-100 outperformance.
    - **Differences**: The current higher interest rate environment and increased regulatory scrutiny on tech giants are notable differences that could dampen the Nasdaq-100's relative performance.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

    - **Interest Rates (↓)**: Rising interest rates decrease the likelihood of Nasdaq-100 outperformance due to potential valuation pressures.
    - **AI Advancements (↑)**: Significant advancements in AI technology increase the likelihood of Nasdaq-100 outperformance.
    - **Regulatory Risks (↓)**: Increased regulatory scrutiny slightly decreases the likelihood of Nasdaq-100 outperformance.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
    - **Prior**: Mean = 0.15 pp, SD = 0.5 pp.
    - **Evidence Impact**: The positive impact of tech earnings and AI advancements is somewhat offset by interest rate concerns and regulatory risks.
    - **Posterior Mean**: Adjust upwards slightly to 0.2 pp due to strong tech sector performance.
    - **Posterior Variance**: Maintain a similar spread due to mixed evidence, with SD remaining around 0.5 pp.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the potential for unexpected regulatory actions or macroeconomic shocks that could disproportionately affect tech stocks.
    - **Alternative Scenario**: A scenario where interest rates rise more than expected could lead to underperformance by the Nasdaq-100.
    - **Tail Risks**: Given the volatility, consider widening the tails slightly to account for unforeseen events.
    
    ### 6. Final Percentiles
    - **P10**: -0.5
    - **P20**: -0.2
    - **P40**: 0.0
    - **P60**: 0.3
    - **P80**: 0.6
    - **P90**: 0.9
    
    These percentiles reflect a slightly optimistic view on the Nasdaq-100's performance relative to the S&P 500, tempered by the current economic and regulatory environment.
