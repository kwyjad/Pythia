### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical Performance of IBEX 35**: Historically, the IBEX 35 has shown an average annual return of around 5-7% over the past two decades. However, this is subject to significant volatility.
- **European Stock Indices**: Other major European indices like the DAX and CAC 40 have similar long-term growth rates, providing a comparative base rate.
- **Limitations**: Economic conditions, political events, and global market trends can cause deviations from historical averages.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- **2025-09-01** ↑ — Spanish GDP growth forecast revised upwards, indicating stronger economic fundamentals.
- **2025-08-15** ↓ — ECB hints at potential interest rate hikes, which could dampen stock market enthusiasm.
- **2025-07-20** ↑ — Positive earnings reports from major IBEX 35 constituents, boosting investor confidence.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Economic Growth**: Moderate impact; stronger GDP growth can boost corporate earnings and stock prices.
- **Monetary Policy**: Large impact; interest rate changes by the ECB can significantly influence market liquidity and investor sentiment.
- **Corporate Earnings**: Moderate impact; positive earnings reports can drive stock prices higher.
- **Political Stability**: Small impact; political events in Spain or the EU can affect investor confidence.
- **Global Market Trends**: Large impact; global economic conditions and market trends can influence the IBEX 35.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Recent Strong Performance**: The IBEX 35 has outperformed many European indices recently, suggesting potential overvaluation.
- **Interest Rate Environment**: Current potential for rising rates contrasts with historically low rates in recent years.
- **Economic Resilience**: Spain's economy has shown resilience post-pandemic, which may not align with past economic cycles.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Assume a moderate probability of the IBEX 35 closing higher, based on historical growth rates (equivalent n = 20).
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Spanish GDP growth forecast (moderate)
  - ↓ ECB interest rate hike potential (large)
  - ↑ Positive corporate earnings (moderate)
- **Net effect**: The posterior should move slightly down due to the significant impact of potential interest rate hikes.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Continued positive GDP growth forecasts.
  - Strong earnings reports from major IBEX 35 companies.
  - Stabilization or reduction in ECB interest rate hike expectations.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - ECB confirming interest rate hikes.
  - Negative economic data from Spain or the EU.
  - Geopolitical tensions affecting European markets.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Uncertainty in Economic Forecasts**: Economic predictions can be volatile and subject to revision.
- **Data Gaps**: Limited real-time data on certain economic indicators.
- **Deception Risks**: Potential for misleading corporate earnings reports.
- **Regime Changes**: Sudden political or economic policy shifts can alter market dynamics.
- **Definitional Gotchas**: Changes in index composition can affect performance comparisons.

Final Research Summary: While the IBEX 35 has shown strong recent performance, potential ECB interest rate hikes pose a significant downside risk. Forecasters should monitor economic indicators and ECB policy closely.

  - Raw output (excerpt):

    To forecast whether the IBEX 35 will close 2025 higher than it started, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    - **Base Rate**: Historically, the IBEX 35 has shown an average annual return of around 5-7%. Given the recent strong performance in 2023 and 2024, a reasonable base rate for the index closing higher in 2025 could be around 60%. This reflects both the historical tendency for stock indices to rise over time and the recent momentum.
    - **Rationale**: The choice of 60% accounts for the historical growth rate and the recent strong performance, while acknowledging the inherent volatility and potential for downturns.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    - **Similarities**: The current situation aligns with the historical base case in terms of economic growth and corporate earnings, which are typical drivers of stock market performance.
    - **Differences**: The potential for ECB interest rate hikes is a significant deviation from the base case, as historically low rates have supported stock market growth. Additionally, the recent strong performance may suggest overvaluation, which could lead to a correction.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    - **Spanish GDP Growth Forecast Revised Upwards**: This is moderately likely if the index closes higher (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)). This evidence slightly increases the probability.
    - **ECB Interest Rate Hike Potential**: This is more likely if the index does not close higher (P(E | ~H) > P(E | H)). This evidence significantly decreases the probability.
    - **Positive Earnings Reports**: This is moderately likely if the index closes higher (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)). This evidence slightly increases the probability.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
    - **Prior Odds**: 60% probability translates to odds of 0.6 / 0.4 = 1.5.
    - **Likelihood Ratios**:
      - GDP Growth: Slightly > 1 (increases probability)
      - Interest Rate Hikes: < 1 (decreases probability significantly)
      - Earnings Reports: Slightly > 1 (increases probability)
    - **Net Effect**: The significant impact of potential interest rate hikes likely outweighs the positive effects of GDP growth and earnings, leading to a downward adjustment.
    - **Posterior Odds**: Adjusting for the evidence, the posterior odds might decrease to around 1.2.
    - **Posterior Probability**: 1.2 / (1 + 1.2) ≈ 54.5%.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    - **Overconfidence Check**: The potential for interest rate hikes is a major risk that could lead to a market correction. The forecast should not be overly optimistic given this downside risk.
    - **Alternative Scenarios**: If the ECB decides against rate hikes or if global markets rally, the probability could be higher. Conversely, geopolitical tensions or negative economic data could further decrease the probability.
    - **Adjustment**: Considering these factors, a slight downward adjustment to account for tail risks is prudent.
    
    ### 6. Final Forecast
    - **Final Probability**: After considering all evidence and potential risks, the final calibrated probability is 53%.
    
    Final: 53%
