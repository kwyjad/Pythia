### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Vaccine DRC Ebola Outbreaks (2020-Present):** This is the most relevant class, as it reflects current response capabilities, including the highly effective rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine (Ervebo), approved in 2019. There have been five such outbreaks in the DRC prior to the current one.
    *   **Base Rate:** The median number of deaths for these outbreaks is 6 (Range: 0-12). The mean is 6.2. These outbreaks were all rapidly contained.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class best represents the modern paradigm of Ebola response where rapid deployment of ring vaccination contains spread. The current outbreak has already surpassed the upper bound of this class, suggesting it is an outlier.
2.  **All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-Present):** This class provides a broader historical perspective on the virus's behavior in the DRC across various contexts. There have been 15 previous outbreaks.
    *   **Base Rate:** The median number of deaths is ~33. The mean is heavily skewed by the 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak to ~200 deaths. Excluding the Kivu outlier, the mean is ~55.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class captures the full range of possibilities, including catastrophic failures of containment (Kivu) and moderate, pre-vaccine outbreaks. The current outbreak's death toll (42) is already above the historical median.
3.  **Outbreaks Exceeding 40 Deaths (Pre-2020):** This class includes outbreaks that escaped initial containment, which the current one appears to have done. There are 6 such historical outbreaks in the DRC.
    *   **Base Rate:** The median number of deaths for this subset is ~225 (Range: 49 - 2280).
    *   **Reasoning:** This class serves as a "disaster" scenario. If we believe the current outbreak has fundamentally broken containment in a way similar to historical episodes, this class provides a grim upper-bound reference.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-04** Outbreak declared in Kasaï Province with 28 suspected cases and 15 deaths. (↑) — Establishes the starting point and indicates transmission was underway for some time before detection.
*   **2025-09-28** Official figures updated to 64 cases and 42 deaths. (↑) — Shows significant growth in the first three weeks, confirming a serious transmission chain that has surpassed recent small outbreaks.
*   **2025-10-01** WHO/ReliefWeb report notes a "decline in transmission" in the preceding week. (↓) — This is the most critical recent data point, suggesting that response efforts (contact tracing, vaccination) are beginning to control the outbreak.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Speed and Efficacy of Response (Large):** The single most important driver. Rapid contact tracing, isolation of cases, and deployment of ring vaccination can halt an outbreak quickly. Delays or failures allow for exponential growth.
*   **Vaccine Availability and Uptake (Large):** The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is highly effective. The ability to quickly vaccinate contacts and contacts-of-contacts is the primary tool for containment in the modern era. Hesitancy or logistical failure would be a major negative driver.
*   **Geographic and Social Context (Moderate):** Outbreaks in dense urban areas or active conflict zones (like Kivu 2018-20) are much harder to control. Kasaï Province has a history of conflict, but is not currently as unstable as the Kivus were, facilitating response efforts.
*   **Community Trust and Cooperation (Moderate):** Mistrust in health authorities can lead to hidden cases, unsafe burials, and attacks on responders, fueling transmission. This was a major factor in the large West Africa and Kivu outbreaks.
*   **Cross-border Spread (Moderate):** Spread to a neighboring country, particularly one with weaker health infrastructure, could dramatically expand the scale of the outbreak. Kasaï borders Angola.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Surpassed Post-Vaccine Norms:** The current death toll of 42 has already exceeded the deadliest post-vaccine DRC outbreak (12 deaths in 2021) by a factor of 3.5. This indicates a significant initial failure or delay in detection and containment compared to the recent norm.
*   **Absence of Major Armed Conflict:** Unlike the 2018-20 Kivu epidemic (2,280 deaths), this outbreak is not in a region of intense, ongoing armed conflict. This is a significant positive difference, allowing responders safer and more complete access.
*   **High Initial Case Fatality Ratio (CFR):** The reported CFR is ~66%. This is higher than the typical ~50% and suggests cases may be detected late in their progression or that therapeutic care is limited, potentially pointing to a strained local health system.
*   **Short Resolution Horizon:** With a resolution date of Jan 1, 2026 (less than 3 months away), there is limited time for a very long tail of deaths to accumulate, unlike outbreaks that smolder for many months or years.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior could be a log-normal distribution anchored on the median of all historical DRC outbreaks (~33 deaths), but with a fat tail to account for the small possibility of a Kivu-scale event. This reflects the reality that most outbreaks are small but some are huge. Equivalent n should be low (e.g., n=5) due to high variance in outcomes.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) Reports of "declining transmission" in late September are the strongest piece of evidence that the outbreak is being brought under control.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The outbreak is not in a major conflict zone, making the response far more feasible than in the Kivu outlier case.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The outbreak has already grown larger than any other in the post-vaccine era, indicating the initial response was not as swift or effective as in recent successes.
    *   (↑ Small) The high CFR suggests weaknesses in the local health system that could have allowed for more initial spread than officially recorded.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests containment is taking hold. The initial negative signal (high early growth) is now outweighed by the positive signal (declining transmission). The posterior should shift significantly away from the fat tail and concentrate probability in the range of 50-100 deaths, representing the current toll plus a limited number of additional deaths before the outbreak is extinguished.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Confirmed cases in a new, geographically separate health zone or a major urban center.
    *   Any confirmed case linked to this outbreak in a neighboring country (e.g., Angola).
    *   Reports of significant community resistance, violence against health workers, or widespread vaccine refusal.
    *   A sustained reversal of the "declining transmission" trend (e.g., >5 new cases per day for a week).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A full 21-day period (one maximum incubation period) with zero new confirmed cases.
    *   Official reports stating that all known contacts have completed their 21-day monitoring period.
    *   High reported vaccination coverage (>90%) among contacts and contacts-of-contacts.
    *   The last confirmed patient being discharged from a treatment center.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Lag and Incompleteness:** Official numbers from remote regions can be delayed and may underrepresent the true scale of the outbreak, especially early on. The current 42 deaths could be revised upwards.
*   **Definition of "Linked":** The resolution criteria include deaths in other countries "linked to this outbreak." A dispute over epidemiological linkage could complicate the final count.
*   **Superspreader Events:** A single event, such as a traditional funeral for an Ebola victim, can reignite an apparently contained outbreak and dramatically change the trajectory.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** The Jan 1, 2026 resolution date means the question is about the death toll in the next ~2.5 months, not the ultimate final toll if the outbreak were to continue past that date. This caps the plausible upper range.

**Final Research Summary:** The outbreak's initial growth was alarming and surpassed recent post-vaccine norms, but the latest evidence points towards successful containment. The absence of major conflict and the power of modern response tools suggest the final death toll will not be dramatically higher than the current count of 42.

To forecast the number of deaths from the current Ebola outbreak in the DRC before January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the post-vaccine DRC Ebola outbreaks (2020-present), with a median of 6 deaths and a mean of 6.2 deaths. However, given the current outbreak's death toll of 42, we must consider broader historical data.
   - **Reasoning:** The current outbreak has already exceeded the post-vaccine norms, suggesting it is an outlier. Therefore, we also consider the broader historical perspective, with a median of ~33 deaths and a mean of ~55 deaths (excluding the Kivu outlier).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The outbreak is in the DRC, where historical data is available. The presence of a vaccine and modern response capabilities are consistent with the post-vaccine era.
   - **Differences:** The current outbreak has already surpassed the deadliest post-vaccine outbreak, indicating a significant initial failure in containment. However, it is not in a major conflict zone, unlike the Kivu outbreak.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Declining Transmission (↓ Large):** Recent reports indicate a decline in transmission, suggesting containment efforts are effective.
   - **Not in Conflict Zone (↓ Moderate):** The outbreak is not in a region of intense conflict, facilitating response efforts.
   - **High Initial Growth (↑ Moderate):** The outbreak's initial growth was significant, surpassing recent norms.
   - **High CFR (↑ Small):** The high case fatality rate suggests potential weaknesses in the local health system.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** A log-normal distribution centered around the historical median of ~33 deaths, with a fat tail for potential larger outcomes.
   - **Update:** The evidence of declining transmission and the absence of conflict shift the distribution towards lower outcomes, concentrating probability in the range of 50-100 deaths.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of data lag or underreporting, which could increase the death toll.
   - **Tail Risks:** Superspreader events or cross-border spread could dramatically change the trajectory.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** If containment fails, the death toll could rise significantly, but current evidence suggests containment is effective.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the evidence and Bayesian updating, the forecasted percentiles are as follows:

P10: 45  
P20: 50  
P40: 60  
P60: 70  
P80: 85  
P90: 100

# Forecasting the Death Toll from the 2025 Kasaï Ebola Outbreak

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use a composite prior based on three reference classes:

1. **Post-vaccine DRC Ebola outbreaks (2020-present)**: Median 6 deaths, mean 6.2 deaths, range 0-12
2. **All historical DRC Ebola outbreaks (1976-present)**: Median ~33 deaths, mean ~200 (or ~55 excluding Kivu)
3. **Outbreaks exceeding 40 deaths (pre-2020)**: Median ~225 deaths, range 49-2280

Given that the current outbreak has already reached 42 deaths, it has surpassed the post-vaccine norm but hasn't yet approached the scale of major historical outbreaks. I'll use a log-normal distribution with a median of ~60 deaths and a significant right tail to account for the possibility of further growth. This prior reflects that the outbreak has already exceeded typical post-vaccine containment but modern response capabilities make a catastrophic outcome less likely.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- The outbreak is in the DRC, which has extensive experience with Ebola
- Modern response tools including the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine are available
- The WHO and international partners are engaged in the response

**Key differences:**
- The current outbreak has already exceeded all post-vaccine outbreaks in the DRC (42 vs. maximum of 12)
- Unlike the catastrophic Kivu outbreak (2018-2020), this outbreak is not in an active conflict zone
- The resolution date is only ~3 months away, limiting the potential for extended transmission
- The reported case fatality rate (~66%) is higher than the typical ~50%, suggesting potential detection or treatment challenges

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast upward:**
- Initial rapid growth to 42 deaths in less than a month suggests early containment failure (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring higher outcomes)
- High case fatality rate suggests possible healthcare system strain or late case detection (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 favoring higher outcomes)
- The outbreak has already surpassed all post-vaccine outbreaks, indicating unusual dynamics (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring higher outcomes)

**Evidence pushing forecast downward:**
- Recent WHO/ReliefWeb report noting "decline in transmission" as of late September (likelihood ratio ~4:1 favoring lower outcomes)
- Absence of major armed conflict in Kasaï (unlike Kivu) allows safer access for responders (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring lower outcomes)
- Modern vaccination protocols have proven highly effective at containing recent outbreaks (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring lower outcomes)
- Short time horizon until resolution (Jan 1, 2026) limits potential growth (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring lower outcomes)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 60 deaths with a significant right tail, I'll update based on the most significant evidence:

**First update - "decline in transmission" report:**
This is the strongest piece of evidence suggesting containment is taking hold. With a likelihood ratio of ~4:1 favoring lower outcomes, this shifts my distribution downward. The posterior median moves from ~60 to ~50 deaths, and the right tail becomes less pronounced.

**Second update - absence of conflict zone dynamics:**
Unlike the Kivu outbreak, responders have safer access. With a likelihood ratio of ~3:1 favoring lower outcomes, this further reduces the probability of extreme outcomes. The posterior median shifts slightly to ~48 deaths, and the right tail contracts further.

**Third update - already exceeded post-vaccine norms:**
With a likelihood ratio of ~2:1 favoring higher outcomes, this partially counteracts the downward pressure. The posterior median shifts back up slightly to ~50 deaths, but the distribution remains narrower than the original prior.

The final posterior distribution has a median around 50 deaths, with most probability mass between 42 (current count) and 80 deaths, and a thinner right tail extending to ~150 deaths.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the "decline in transmission" report if it's based on incomplete data
- The short time horizon might be causing me to underestimate the potential for a sudden acceleration
- I might be overconfident in modern containment capabilities based on recent successes

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Hidden transmission chains**: There could be undetected cases in remote areas that suddenly emerge (pushing the toll to 100-150)
- **Cross-border spread**: If cases appear in Angola, containment becomes more complex (pushing the toll to 150-300)
- **Super-spreader event**: A traditional funeral or healthcare setting could cause a sudden spike (pushing the toll to 80-120)

**Adjustments needed:**
- I should widen my distribution slightly to account for data uncertainty
- I should ensure my P80 and P90 values adequately capture the possibility of containment failure

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 43
P20: 45
P40: 50
P60: 60
P80: 85
P90: 120

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate starting point is a prior distribution based on the historical record of all 15 previous Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since 1976. This reference class is broad enough to include a wide range of outcomes, from small, quickly contained events to catastrophic epidemics.

*   **Base Rate Distribution**: This class has a median of approximately 33 deaths. The distribution is highly right-skewed, with a mean of around 200, heavily influenced by the 2018-20 Kivu outbreak (2,280 deaths). A log-normal distribution is a suitable model for this prior, reflecting that most outbreaks are small but a few can become extremely large.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation has critical differences from the historical base case, which warrant significant adjustments to the prior.

*   **Similarities**: The outbreak is in the DRC, a region with deep experience in Ebola response, and involves the same viral agent.
*   **Differences (Factors pushing the forecast down)**:
    1.  **Effective Vaccine**: The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, approved in 2019, is a game-changer that was unavailable for most historical outbreaks. Its use in ring vaccination strategies dramatically increases the probability of successful containment.
    2.  **Absence of Major Conflict**: Unlike the catastrophic Kivu outbreak (2018-20), the current outbreak in Kasaï Province is not in a zone of intense armed conflict, which allows for safer and more effective response efforts.
*   **Differences (Factors pushing the forecast up)**:
    1.  **Initial Containment Failure**: With 42 deaths already, this outbreak has surpassed the death toll of all five post-vaccine outbreaks in the DRC combined. This indicates a significant delay in detection or a less effective initial response compared to the modern norm.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of recent evidence to update the prior.

*   **Evidence 1: Current scale (42 deaths as of Sep 28)**. This evidence makes very low final outcomes (<42) impossible and suggests that whatever containment mechanisms were in place initially were insufficient. This strongly pushes the distribution to the right, past the historical median of 33.
*   **Evidence 2: Report of "decline in transmission" (as of Oct 1)**. This is the most powerful piece of new information. It is highly consistent with a scenario where the outbreak has peaked and is being brought under control. It dramatically lowers the likelihood of the fat-tail, catastrophic scenarios (hundreds or thousands of deaths). This evidence strongly pulls the upper end of the distribution down.
*   **Evidence 3: Short time horizon (resolution on Jan 1, 2026)**. There are fewer than three months until the resolution date. Given Ebola's incubation and disease progression timeline, this physically limits the number of additional deaths that can occur. This further reduces the probability of very high outcomes and compresses the right tail of the distribution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior**: A right-skewed distribution with a median of ~33 deaths and a fat tail.
*   **Update Step 1 (Initial Size)**: The fact that the death toll is already 42 shifts our entire distribution to the right. The floor is now 42. The evidence of a larger-than-expected initial outbreak increases the probability of a moderately high outcome (e.g., 70-150 deaths) compared to the prior.
*   **Update Step 2 (Containment Signals)**: The report of declining transmission, combined with the short time horizon and absence of conflict, acts as a strong counterweight. This evidence suggests the exponential growth phase is over. The posterior distribution's right tail should be significantly truncated. The probability mass should now be concentrated in a range reflecting the current death toll plus a limited number of additional deaths from existing and new, but contained, transmission chains.
*   **Posterior Shape**: The resulting posterior distribution is anchored at a minimum of 42. My central estimate is that deaths from the 22 currently active cases plus a small number of new cases will bring the total to around 65-75. The distribution remains right-skewed to account for the possibility that containment falters, but the tail is much thinner than the prior's.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is heavily reliant on the "decline in transmission" report being accurate and sustained. A key risk is that this report is premature or that a superspreader event (e.g., a traditional funeral) reignites a transmission chain. Furthermore, the official count of 42 deaths could be an undercount of the true situation on the ground.

To account for these risks, I will increase my median estimate slightly and widen the upper percentiles. An alternative, more pessimistic forecast would discount the report of declining transmission and place more weight on the initial failure, pointing to a final toll closer to 100-150. However, I believe the combination of modern tools (vaccine), favorable conditions (no major conflict), and the short time horizon makes a catastrophic outcome highly unlikely. My P90 of 125 reflects a scenario where containment falters for several weeks but is eventually re-established, a plausible worst-case scenario before January 1st.
