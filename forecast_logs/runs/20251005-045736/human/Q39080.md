### Reference class & base rates
1.  **US Government Bailouts of Major Corporations (2008-2010):** During the 2008 financial crisis, the US Treasury (under the TARP program) took equity stakes or warrants in numerous banks (Citigroup, Bank of America), AIG, and auto manufacturers (GM, Chrysler). This occurred in ~10-15 major, publicly traded companies over a 2-3 year crisis period.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~5-10% chance per year in a non-crisis period for the government to take an equity stake in a major strategic company as part of a financial package.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the most prominent modern example of the US government taking direct equity in large private firms. However, the context was an acute systemic crisis and saving firms from imminent collapse, not strategic industrial policy for healthy companies. This makes it a weak but relevant reference class.

2.  **US Industrial Policy & Strategic Investment (Post-WWII):** Historically, the US government has preferred grants, loan guarantees, and procurement contracts to direct equity when fostering strategic industries (e.g., aerospace, early internet, biotech). Direct equity stakes are exceptionally rare.
    *   **Base Rate:** <1% chance in any given year.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class reflects the standard operating procedure of US industrial policy for over 70 years. The current situation proposes a significant departure from this long-standing norm.

3.  **Global Sovereign Wealth Fund / State-Owned Enterprise Investments:** Governments in countries like Singapore (Temasek), Norway, or China frequently take equity stakes in domestic and foreign companies to advance national strategic and economic interests.
    *   **Base Rate:** High (20-40%+) for a targeted strategic company to receive a state-backed equity investment in those countries.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class is useful for understanding the *logic* of the proposed policy but is a poor fit for the US political and economic system, which has traditionally avoided this model. It represents the paradigm the hypothetical administration is moving *towards*.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-08-28] Intel accepts a deal including a 10% government equity stake for $5.7B in CHIPS funding. — ↑ (Large) — Establishes a powerful, concrete precedent and demonstrates the administration's serious intent to pursue this new policy model.
*   [2025-08-25] Trump administration vows to target other semiconductor firms with similar equity-for-funding deals. — ↑ (Moderate) — Signals that the Intel deal was not a one-off but the intended template for the entire CHIPS program going forward.
*   [2025-08-21] TSMC states it would consider returning subsidies if equity demands are made official. — ↓ (Moderate) — Shows that major foreign firms have leverage and are willing to push back, potentially derailing or delaying negotiations past the deadline.
*   [2025-08-21] US Trade Secretary clarifies policy will not apply to TSMC and Micron. — ↓ (Large) — Explicitly removes two of the five companies from the target list, significantly narrowing the avenues for a "Yes" resolution.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Transactional "America First" Industrial Policy:** The administration's core ideology views subsidies as "handouts" and seeks a direct financial return for the taxpayer, treating government funding like a venture capital investment. This is the primary driver for a "Yes" resolution. (Size: Large)
2.  **Corporate Leverage & Alternatives:** Target companies are not failing; they are profitable and have other capital-raising options. They can negotiate, delay, or threaten to cancel/downsize US projects, as TSMC demonstrated. This is the primary driver for a "No" resolution. (Size: Large)
3.  **Urgency of CHIPS Funding:** The companies' need for the CHIPS funding to de-risk and accelerate massive, capital-intensive fab construction gives the government leverage. The more critical the funds are to a company's timeline and budget, the more likely they are to accept unfavorable terms. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Bureaucratic & Legal Friction:** Repurposing the CHIPS Act from a grant/subsidy program to an equity investment vehicle may face legal challenges or significant administrative delays. With a resolution deadline of Jan 1, 2026, the government may not be able to finalize a complex equity deal in time. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Foreign Relations & Geopolitics:** Aggressively targeting foreign-owned firms like Samsung (South Korea) could create diplomatic friction with key allies, potentially softening the administration's negotiating stance for those specific companies. This is less of a factor for US-based GlobalFoundries and Microchip. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Proactive Investment vs. Reactive Bailout:** Unlike the 2008 crisis (Reference Class 1), the government is not rescuing failing companies. It is using its financial power to shape industrial strategy in profitable, healthy firms, which gives the companies much more leverage to refuse terms.
*   **Shift in US Policy Doctrine:** This situation represents a potential paradigm shift away from the traditional US model of grants and loans (Reference Class 2) and towards a state-capitalist model (Reference Class 3), making historical precedent less reliable.
*   **Specific Legislative Mandate (CHIPS Act):** The policy is being executed through a specific, pre-existing legislative vehicle. The original intent of the CHIPS Act did not explicitly include equity stakes, creating a tension between the administration's goals and the program's design.
*   **Concentrated Target Set:** The question is not about the economy at large, but about three specific companies (Samsung, GlobalFoundries, Microchip) after two were already exempted, making the outcome dependent on a very small number of individual corporate negotiations.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A low prior, perhaps 10-15%, based on the rarity of such interventions (Ref Class 1 & 2), with low confidence (equivalent n≈10) due to the poor fit of the reference classes.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The Intel deal serves as a "proof of concept" and a strong signal of intent, dramatically increasing the possibility.
    *   ↓ (Large): The explicit exemption of TSMC and Micron halves the number of potential targets and shows the administration is willing to make concessions.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): TSMC's public resistance demonstrates that powerful companies can effectively counter the policy, providing a playbook for the remaining targets.
    *   ↓ (Small): The very short timeline (<3 months) acts as a brake, as complex equity negotiations and legal reviews are difficult to complete quickly.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is conflicting. The powerful "up" signal from the Intel precedent is significantly counteracted by the "down" signal of key exemptions. The posterior should move moderately upwards from the very low base rate, but likely remain below 50%, as the path to a "Yes" has been substantially narrowed.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public statements from the Commerce Department or White House reaffirming the "equity for all" model for remaining CHIPS recipients.
    *   Leaked reports of ongoing negotiations with Samsung, GlobalFoundries, or Microchip that include warrants or equity clauses.
    *   An announcement of a CHIPS funding award to one of the target companies that is "pending final terms."
    *   Key executives from target companies visiting Washington D.C. for high-level meetings.

*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Official Commerce Dept. guidance is released that creates carve-outs or alternative structures that avoid direct equity.
    *   Samsung, GlobalFoundries, or Microchip publicly state their opposition to equity terms.
    *   Any of the target companies announce they are proceeding with US expansion using alternative financing, forgoing CHIPS funds.
    *   Congressional leaders from either party launch inquiries or hearings critical of the administration's policy shift.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Hypothetical Scenario:** The entire background is a hypothetical set in the near future. The actors' behaviors are projections and may not reflect their real-world actions.
*   **Resolution Ambiguity ("Stock"):** The term "stock" could be interpreted broadly. A deal could involve warrants (options to buy stock at a set price) rather than direct common stock. Warrants are a common feature of government deals (e.g., TARP) and would almost certainly count as "Yes" but might be framed publicly as a less intrusive measure.
*   **Symbolic Stakes:** A "Yes" could be triggered by a token acquisition (e.g., 0.01% stake or a small number of warrants) to save face for the administration while conceding to the company's core demands. The probability of *some* deal is higher than the probability of a *substantive* deal like Intel's.
*   **Short Timeline:** With a deadline of Jan 1, 2026, any bureaucratic delay, protracted negotiation, or legal challenge could easily push a final agreement into 2026, causing the question to resolve "No" even if a deal is eventually imminent.

**Final Research Summary:** The administration has established a new and aggressive precedent for seeking equity, but strong corporate pushback has already forced major concessions. The outcome now hinges on the specific negotiations with the three remaining, less powerful companies on an extremely tight deadline.

To forecast the probability of the US government acquiring stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the historical frequency of the US government taking equity stakes in major companies outside of crisis periods, which is estimated at 5-10% per year. This is based on the 2008-2010 financial crisis interventions, which are not directly comparable but provide a weak reference point for government equity stakes in large firms.
   - Initial prior: Let's use a midpoint of 7.5% as the base rate for this scenario.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves the US government potentially taking equity stakes in large, strategic companies, similar to past interventions.
   - Differences: Unlike past bailouts, this is a proactive industrial policy move, not a crisis response. The companies are not failing, and the government is using financial leverage to shape industrial strategy, which is a significant departure from historical norms.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Intel Deal (↑ Large):** The Intel precedent strongly suggests the administration's intent to pursue equity stakes, increasing the likelihood of similar deals with other companies.
   - **Exemption of TSMC and Micron (↓ Large):** This significantly reduces the pool of potential targets, decreasing the probability.
   - **TSMC's Resistance (↓ Moderate):** Demonstrates that companies can effectively resist, decreasing the likelihood.
   - **Short Timeline (↓ Small):** The tight deadline makes it challenging to finalize complex deals, slightly decreasing the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 7.5% translates to odds of 0.075 / (1 - 0.075) = 0.081.
   - Likelihood ratio: The Intel deal increases the odds, but the exemptions and resistance decrease them. Let's assume a net moderate increase, adjusting the odds to approximately 0.12.
   - Posterior probability: 0.12 / (1 + 0.12) ≈ 10.7%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the administration's determination or overestimate corporate resistance.
   - Alternative scenario: A symbolic or token equity stake could be negotiated quickly, which might resolve the question as "Yes" even if substantial deals are not reached.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of a small, face-saving deal being reached, slightly increasing the probability.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for a symbolic deal, the final probability is adjusted to reflect these factors.

Final: 15%

# Will the US government acquire stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the US government acquiring stock in any of the remaining eligible semiconductor companies (Samsung, Global Foundries, or Microchip Technology) before January 1, 2026.

The most relevant reference classes are:
- US government equity stakes in strategic private companies during non-crisis periods
- Recent precedent of the repurposed CHIPS Act implementation

Historically, the US government rarely takes equity stakes in private companies outside of financial crises. The 2008-2009 financial crisis (TARP program) was exceptional, and even then was focused on preventing systemic collapse rather than industrial policy.

**Prior probability:** 15%

**Reasoning:** This is higher than the historical base rate (<5%) because the Trump administration has explicitly changed policy direction with the CHIPS Act implementation, as evidenced by the Intel deal. However, it remains low because such government equity stakes remain rare in the US context, especially for healthy companies in non-crisis situations.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The US government traditionally prefers subsidies, loans, and procurement contracts over direct equity stakes
- Corporate resistance to government ownership remains strong in the US business environment
- Legal and administrative hurdles exist for transforming a subsidy program into an equity investment vehicle

**Key differences:**
- The Intel precedent (10% stake for $5.7B) establishes a concrete template for similar deals
- The Trump administration has explicitly stated its intention to replicate this model with other semiconductor companies
- The CHIPS Act provides a specific legislative vehicle and funding source for these potential equity acquisitions
- The timeline is extremely short (less than 3 months until the resolution date)
- Two major companies (TSMC and Micron) have already been exempted, narrowing the field of potential targets

These differences significantly increase the probability compared to historical patterns, but the short timeline and corporate resistance are substantial limiting factors.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Intel deal with 10% government stake**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the government will acquire stakes in other companies, the Intel precedent would be a necessary first step
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - The Intel deal could be a one-off exception even if no other deals materialize
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- Direction: Increases probability significantly

**Evidence 2: TSMC and Micron exemptions**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even if the government will acquire stakes in other companies, strategic exemptions for some firms are plausible
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - If the policy will ultimately fail, early exemptions for powerful companies would be expected
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5
- Direction: Decreases probability moderately

**Evidence 3: TSMC's resistance and willingness to return subsidies**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - Such strong resistance would be unlikely if the policy were destined to succeed broadly
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Corporate pushback is expected if the policy will ultimately fail
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.29
- Direction: Decreases probability substantially

**Evidence 4: Short timeline (less than 3 months until 2026)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Equity deals can be completed quickly when there's political pressure
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.9) - Complex equity negotiations often take many months, especially with reluctant partners
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.56
- Direction: Decreases probability moderately

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 15% (odds of 0.176):

**Update on Intel deal:**
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 3.0 = 0.528
- Posterior probability: 0.528 / (1 + 0.528) = 34.6%

**Update on TSMC/Micron exemptions:**
- Prior odds: 0.528
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds: 0.528 × 0.5 = 0.264
- Posterior probability: 0.264 / (1 + 0.264) = 20.9%

**Update on TSMC resistance:**
- Prior odds: 0.264
- Likelihood ratio: 0.29
- Posterior odds: 0.264 × 0.29 = 0.077
- Posterior probability: 0.077 / (1 + 0.077) = 7.1%

**Update on short timeline:**
- Prior odds: 0.077
- Likelihood ratio: 0.56
- Posterior odds: 0.077 × 0.56 = 0.043
- Posterior probability: 0.043 / (1 + 0.043) = 4.1%

This sequential updating may be overly aggressive, so I'll adjust my final estimate based on a more holistic assessment.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the Trump administration's determination to implement this policy quickly
- Samsung, as a foreign company with significant US operations, might be more willing to accept equity terms to maintain good relations with the US
- GlobalFoundries or Microchip Technology might be more dependent on CHIPS funding than I've assumed
- The administration could structure deals with minimal equity (e.g., warrants or convertible instruments) that would still count as "stock" for resolution purposes

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast would be 25-30%, arguing that:
1. The Intel precedent is extremely powerful and recent
2. The administration has strong incentives to secure at least one more deal before year-end
3. Smaller companies like GlobalFoundries or Microchip have less leverage than TSMC
4. Creative financial structures could make deals more palatable to companies

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While these points have merit, they don't adequately address:
1. The extremely short timeline (less than 3 months)
2. The legal and administrative hurdles of repurposing the CHIPS Act
3. The demonstrated willingness of companies to resist and the administration to grant exemptions
4. The fact that healthy companies have alternative financing options

Considering these factors, I believe my forecast should be adjusted upward from the 4.1% derived from sequential updating, but remain below 20% given the significant obstacles.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the historical base rates, the specific evidence in this case, and potential blind spots, I assess that there is approximately a 15% chance that the US government will acquire stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026.

This reflects:
- The powerful precedent of the Intel deal
- The explicit policy shift by the Trump administration
- Balanced against the demonstrated corporate resistance
- The extremely short timeline before resolution (less than 3 months)
- The narrowed field of potential targets after TSMC and Micron exemptions

Final: 15%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The event in question is the US government taking an equity stake in a healthy, private semiconductor company as part of an industrial policy initiative. This is a significant departure from standard US practice.

*   **Reference Class:** US industrial policy post-WWII. Historically, the US government has used grants, loan guarantees, and procurement contracts to support strategic industries. Direct equity stakes in healthy companies are exceptionally rare. The base rate for such an event occurring with any given strategic company in a normal year would be very low, likely less than 1%.
*   **Reference Class Adjustment:** The current situation is not a normal year. There is an explicit, publicly stated policy shift by the administration to pursue this model, using the CHIPS Act as a vehicle. This is a strong signal of intent that significantly elevates the probability above the historical baseline.
*   **Chosen Prior:** I will set the prior probability at **15%**. This acknowledges that the action is historically rare (keeping the probability low) but accounts for the specific, stated intention of the administration to make it happen, which makes it a plausible outcome. This corresponds to prior odds of approximately 1-to-6 against the event.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The government is using financial leverage to achieve strategic goals in a critical industry, which is consistent with the broad aims of past industrial policies.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Proactive Investment vs. Reactive Bailout:** Unlike the 2008 crisis bailouts (the main precedent for government equity stakes), these semiconductor companies are profitable and not facing collapse. This gives them significant negotiating leverage to refuse terms they dislike, a key difference that lowers the probability of the government succeeding.
    *   **Paradigm Shift:** The administration is attempting to import a state-capitalist tool into a system that has traditionally avoided it. This novelty means historical precedent is a weak guide, and the outcome depends heavily on the specific political and corporate dynamics of the moment.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their impact on the initial 15% prior.

*   **Evidence 1: The Intel Deal (Strongly Increases Probability)**
    *   The government successfully negotiated a 10% equity stake with Intel. This serves as a powerful proof-of-concept.
    *   P(E | H): If the government plans to acquire stock in other companies (H), it is very likely they would first secure a deal with a major domestic player like Intel to set a precedent.
    *   P(E | ~H): If the government was not going to acquire stock in any other company (~H), it's much less likely they would have gone through the effort to create this one-off template.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Significantly greater than 1. This evidence transforms the question from a hypothetical ("Could they do this?") to a practical one ("Can they replicate this success?").

*   **Evidence 2: Exemption of TSMC and Micron (Strongly Decreases Probability)**
    *   The administration explicitly stated the new equity requirement would not apply to TSMC and Micron following public pushback from TSMC.
    *   P(E | H): This is less likely. If the goal was to apply this policy broadly, making major concessions and exempting two of the five targets so quickly undermines the effort and makes a "Yes" resolution (which requires a deal with *any* of the companies) less probable.
    *   P(E | ~H): This is very likely. If no deal is ultimately made with the remaining companies (~H), it is highly probable that it's because the policy faced insurmountable resistance, of which the TSMC/Micron exemption is the primary example.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Significantly less than 1. This evidence is a major blow to the hypothesis, as it removes 40% of the potential targets and demonstrates that corporate and diplomatic pressure is an effective countermeasure.

*   **Evidence 3: The Short Timeline (Strongly Decreases Probability)**
    *   The resolution deadline is January 1, 2026, which is less than three months from the current date (October 5, 2025).
    *   P(E | H): It is unlikely that a complex, novel equity negotiation between a government and a major corporation could be initiated and finalized in such a short period, unless talks are already at an advanced stage.
    *   P(E | ~H): It is very likely that if no deal happens, the short timeline will be a key contributing factor, as negotiations stall or simply run out of time.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Significantly less than 1. This is a major practical barrier that heavily favors a "No" outcome.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Let's walk through the updates conceptually.

1.  **Start with the Prior:** 15% (or ~1:6 odds).
2.  **Apply Intel Deal Evidence:** The successful Intel deal is a massive positive update. It proves the administration's intent and capability. This could plausibly increase the odds by a factor of 4, moving the probability to ~40%. (New odds: 4:6 or 2:3).
3.  **Apply TSMC/Micron Exemption:** This is a powerful negative update. It removes two key targets and shows the policy is not absolute. This cuts the probability significantly. If it halves the odds, we move from 40% back down to ~25%. (New odds: 1:3).
4.  **Apply Timeline Evidence:** The <3 month deadline is a severe constraint. This further reduces the probability of success. A conservative update might reduce the odds by another third, bringing the probability down to ~20%.

To refine this, I will use a bottom-up estimate on the three remaining companies:
*   **Samsung:** A foreign powerhouse like TSMC, likely to resist successfully. P(deal) ≈ 5%.
*   **GlobalFoundries:** A US-based company, smaller than Intel, and potentially more dependent on CHIPS funding. The most likely candidate. P(deal) ≈ 20%.
*   **Microchip Technology:** Another US-based company, also a plausible but perhaps less central target. P(deal) ≈ 10%.

The probability of at least one deal is 1 - P(no deals) = 1 - (0.95 * 0.80 * 0.90) = 1 - 0.684 = **31.6%**. This approach, which focuses on the remaining paths to a "Yes" resolution, feels more robust.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Overconfidence in "No":** Am I underestimating the administration's ability to move quickly and decisively, as demonstrated by the Intel deal? It's possible a deal with GlobalFoundries is already near completion and is simply awaiting a politically opportune moment for announcement. The timeline might be a "forcing function" rather than an obstacle.
*   **Resolution Ambiguity:** The term "stock" could include warrants (options to buy stock), which are a less intrusive instrument that a company might accept as a compromise. This flexibility increases the number of ways a "Yes" can be achieved.
*   **Alternative View:** The Intel deal was the big prize. The TSMC/Micron exemption was a necessary concession to an ally. The administration may now focus all its leverage on one of the remaining US firms (GlobalFoundries or Microchip) to secure a second, smaller win to prove the policy is not a one-off. In this view, the probability is concentrated on one or two companies, and could be higher than my estimate.

Considering these points, particularly the possibility of a near-complete deal and the flexibility afforded by warrants, I will adjust my estimate slightly upward from the calculated 31.6%. The core factors—strong corporate resistance and a very short timeline—still make "No" the more likely outcome, but the probability of "Yes" is substantial.

### 6. Final Forecast

My final probability reflects a balance between the powerful precedent set by the Intel deal and the significant obstacles posed by corporate resistance, major concessions already made by the government, and an extremely short timeline. The path to a "Yes" has narrowed to three companies, and while a deal with any single one is unlikely, the possibility of one success out of three attempts remains significant.

Final: 32%
