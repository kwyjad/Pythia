### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Countries on the FATF grey list.** Historically, countries spend an average of 2-3 years on the grey list. South Africa was listed in February 2023, so an October 2025 removal (~2.7 years) would be typical. The annual probability of a country being removed is roughly 30-40%. **Base Rate: 35% per year.**
-   **Reference Class 2: Countries that have "substantially completed" their action plan and been granted an on-site visit.** This is a much more specific and relevant reference class. The on-site visit is the final verification step before the FATF plenary considers delisting. Historically, the vast majority of countries that reach this stage are removed at the next plenary meeting. Failure at this stage is rare and usually involves the discovery of significant misrepresentation or a major new negative development. **Base Rate: 85-95%.**
-   **Limitations:** The FATF's decision-making is a consensus-based process among member states and can be opaque. While the process is largely technical, geopolitical factors can play a role, though this is less common for grey-list decisions than for black-list ones. The sample size for Reference Class 2 is smaller, making the base rate an estimate.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-09-30] Reports from Business Insider and BusinessTech indicate the on-site visit was successful and assessors noted significant progress. — ↑ — Positive outcome of the on-site visit is the final major evidentiary hurdle before the plenary vote.
-   [2025-06-23] Business Leadership South Africa CEO expresses high confidence in an October exit, framing it as overcoming the "State-capture legacy." — ↑ — Signals strong alignment and confidence from the private sector, a key partner in implementing AML/CFT reforms.
-   [2025-06-13] FATF Plenary officially determines South Africa has "substantially completed its action plan" and warrants an on-site assessment. — ↑ — This is the most critical official milestone, moving the country from the "remediation" phase to the final "verification" phase.
-   [2025-06-13] South Africa's National Treasury confirms the FATF's assessment that all 22 action items are now substantially complete. — ↑ — Official government confirmation of meeting all technical requirements of the action plan.
-   [2025-02-24] Baker McKenzie report notes SA had addressed 20 of 22 action items, with the final two (on sustained investigations) due by June. — ↑ — Shows a clear and credible trajectory of progress leading up to the June plenary.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Action Plan Completion (Large):** The core mechanism is technical. A country must address all deficiencies in its FATF action plan. South Africa has officially met this threshold, which is the primary driver for delisting.
-   **On-Site Visit Verification (Large):** The FATF must verify that the reported reforms are implemented in practice and are sustainable. Positive reports from the recent on-site visit are a powerful driver toward a "Yes" resolution.
-   **Political Will & Commitment (Moderate):** The South African government, particularly the National Treasury, has demonstrated sustained high-level commitment. This prevents backsliding and assures the FATF that reforms will be maintained.
-   **Public-Private Partnership (Small-to-Moderate):** Strong collaboration between the government and the financial/business sector (e.g., Business Leadership SA) has accelerated implementation and demonstrated a whole-of-society effort, which the FATF views favorably.
-   **Major New Scandal (Large, but low probability):** The discovery of a massive, unaddressed money laundering or terror financing case involving senior officials before the October meeting could derail the process by undermining the "sustainability" and "effectiveness" arguments.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Strong Narrative of Reform:** Unlike some countries where reforms are purely technical, South Africa's effort is explicitly tied to overcoming the well-documented "State Capture" era. This provides a powerful political narrative and a strong incentive to demonstrate a clean break from the past.
-   **High Level of Transparency:** The South African National Treasury has been unusually public and transparent about its progress, providing regular updates and building confidence both domestically and internationally.
-   **Rapid Pace of Addressing Deficiencies:** While the overall time on the list is average, the pace of clearing the final, most difficult action items (related to enforcement and prosecution) in the first half of 2025 was rapid, indicating a significant surge in capacity and focus.
-   **Consensus View:** There is a strong consensus among government, business leaders, and media reporting that the delisting is imminent. There is a notable absence of significant dissenting or cautionary voices, which is unusual for such a high-stakes issue.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Based on the most relevant reference class (countries granted an on-site visit), a reasonable prior is ~90% with an equivalent n=10, reflecting a strong but not certain starting point.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   ↑ (Large): The official FATF statement in June 2025 confirming the action plan was complete and authorizing the on-site visit. This moves the probability from the general base rate to the specific, high-confidence one.
    -   ↑ (Moderate-to-Large): Multiple media reports in September 2025, citing assessors, that the on-site visit was successful. This confirms the final verification step went as planned.
    -   ↑ (Small): Consistent, confident messaging from both government (Treasury) and the private sector (BLSA) throughout the period.
    -   ↑ (Small): The absence of any negative news or new scandals that could have derailed the process in the final months.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence is uniformly positive and strongly confirms the high prior. The posterior should move significantly upward, approaching certainty while retaining a small residual for unforeseen events.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Pre-plenary statements of support from key FATF member countries.
    -   Positive forward-looking statements from the South African Minister of Finance or National Treasury.
    -   Leaked drafts or rumors from working group meetings in the week of the plenary (Oct 20-24) suggesting a positive outcome.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Any major new corruption or money-laundering scandal breaking in South Africa before the meeting.
    -   Negative leaks from the FATF plenary suggesting a last-minute technicality or political objection has been raised.
    -   Statements from FATF or South African officials that suggest a delay for further observation, pushing the decision to the next plenary in early 2026.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Confirmation Bias:** The available sources are uniformly positive. This may reflect a genuine consensus, but it also raises the risk of groupthink and overlooking subtle negative signals.
-   **Plenary is a "Black Box":** The final decision is made by consensus in a closed-door meeting. While the technical recommendation from the on-site visit carries immense weight, a political objection from a key member state, though unlikely, cannot be entirely ruled out.
-   **Resolution Timing:** The question resolves based on the outcome of the *fall 2025 meeting*. A decision to delay the vote to the next plenary (e.g., February 2026) for any reason would resolve this question as "No," even if delisting remains likely.
-   **"Substantially Completed" vs. "Fully Completed":** The FATF's language ("substantially completed") leaves a small margin of discretion. If the on-site visit revealed that the remaining gaps were more significant than expected, it could lead to a negative outcome. However, recent reporting suggests this is not the case.

**Final Research Summary:** South Africa has met all technical benchmarks and successfully passed the critical on-site verification visit. All available evidence points to a formal decision to remove the country from the FATF grey list at the October 2025 plenary.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is from Reference Class 2: countries that have "substantially completed" their action plan and been granted an on-site visit. Historically, the vast majority of these countries are removed from the grey list at the next plenary meeting. The base rate for this scenario is approximately 85-95%. I will use 90% as a reasonable prior probability, reflecting a strong likelihood of removal given the historical data.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: South Africa has completed its action plan and passed the on-site visit, aligning closely with the reference class where countries are typically removed from the grey list.
   - Differences: South Africa's situation is bolstered by a strong narrative of reform and transparency, which may further increase the likelihood of removal. However, the decision-making process is consensus-based and could be influenced by geopolitical factors, though this is less common for grey-list decisions.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Positive outcome of the on-site visit: This is a strong indicator that the FATF will likely remove South Africa from the grey list. The likelihood ratio is high, as successful on-site visits typically lead to removal.
   - Consistent positive messaging from government and private sector: This further supports the likelihood of removal, though it is a smaller factor compared to the on-site visit.
   - Absence of negative news or scandals: This maintains the high probability of removal, as new negative developments could have decreased the likelihood.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 9:1 (90% probability of removal)
   - The evidence from the successful on-site visit and positive messaging strongly supports the hypothesis of removal, reinforcing the prior.
   - Posterior odds remain high, and the posterior probability approaches certainty, though a small residual uncertainty remains for unforeseen events.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could arise from the uniformly positive evidence. However, the lack of dissenting voices and the successful completion of the action plan and on-site visit strongly support the forecast.
   - Tail risks include geopolitical factors or last-minute technical objections, but these are unlikely given the current evidence.
   - An alternative forecast might consider a delay in the decision, but this seems improbable given the current trajectory and evidence.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the strong alignment with the reference class, successful completion of the action plan, positive on-site visit, and consistent positive messaging, the probability of South Africa being removed from the FATF grey list at the fall 2025 meeting is very high.

Final: 95%

# Will South Africa be removed from the FATF grey-list at the fall 2025 meeting?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify the most appropriate reference class. There are two relevant reference classes:

**Reference Class 1:** Countries on the FATF grey list in general
- Countries typically spend 2-3 years on the grey list
- Annual removal rate is approximately 30-40%
- Base rate: ~35% per year

**Reference Class 2:** Countries that have "substantially completed" their action plan and received an on-site visit
- This is a much more specific and relevant reference class
- Historical success rate at this stage is very high (85-95%)
- Base rate: ~90%

I'll use Reference Class 2 as my prior because South Africa has officially "substantially completed" its action plan and received an on-site visit, which places it in this specific category. This is a much stronger predictor than just being on the grey list in general.

**Prior probability: 90%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- South Africa has followed the standard FATF process for removal
- It has completed its action plan and received the critical on-site visit
- The timeframe (2.7 years on the list) is typical for countries that successfully exit

**Differences from base case:**
- South Africa has shown unusually strong transparency in its reform process
- There is an explicit narrative of overcoming the "State Capture" era
- The pace of addressing final deficiencies in 2025 has been rapid
- There is an unusually strong consensus among government, business leaders, and media that removal is imminent

These differences generally strengthen the case for removal compared to the typical country at this stage.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: FATF officially determined South Africa "substantially completed its action plan" (June 2025)**
- P(E|H): ~0.99 (Almost certain if removal will occur)
- P(E|~H): ~0.10 (Very unlikely if removal won't occur)
- Likelihood ratio: ~9.9
- This is the most critical official milestone and strongly increases probability

**Evidence 2: Successful on-site visit reported in September 2025**
- P(E|H): ~0.95 (Very likely if removal will occur)
- P(E|~H): ~0.05 (Very unlikely if removal won't occur)
- Likelihood ratio: ~19
- The on-site visit is the final verification step, and its success strongly increases probability

**Evidence 3: South Africa has addressed all 22 action items**
- P(E|H): ~0.98 (Almost certain if removal will occur)
- P(E|~H): ~0.15 (Unlikely if removal won't occur)
- Likelihood ratio: ~6.5
- Meeting all technical requirements is necessary for removal and increases probability

**Evidence 4: Strong consensus among government and business leaders**
- P(E|H): ~0.90 (Likely if removal will occur)
- P(E|~H): ~0.30 (Somewhat unlikely if removal won't occur)
- Likelihood ratio: ~3
- Moderately increases probability

**Evidence 5: Absence of new scandals or negative developments**
- P(E|H): ~0.85 (Likely if removal will occur)
- P(E|~H): ~0.40 (Somewhat likely even if removal won't occur)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.1
- Slightly increases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 90:10 or 9:1

First update (Evidence 1):
- Prior odds: 9:1
- Likelihood ratio: 9.9
- Posterior odds: 9 × 9.9 = 89.1:1
- Posterior probability: 89.1/(89.1+1) ≈ 98.9%

Second update (Evidence 2):
- Prior odds: 89.1:1
- Likelihood ratio: 19
- Posterior odds: 89.1 × 19 = 1692.9:1
- Posterior probability: 1692.9/(1692.9+1) ≈ 99.9%

This is becoming unrealistically high, suggesting I should be more conservative in my likelihood ratios. The evidence is strongly positive, but I should account for the possibility of unforeseen events and the inherent uncertainty in the FATF's consensus-based decision process.

Adjusting to a more reasonable posterior: ~97%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- The available sources are uniformly positive, which raises the risk of confirmation bias
- The FATF plenary is a "black box" where political considerations could emerge
- "Substantially completed" leaves room for interpretation; there could be remaining issues
- A major new scandal could emerge in the next two weeks before the meeting

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The FATF could decide to delay the decision to the next plenary (February 2026) for further monitoring
- A key FATF member country could raise a last-minute objection
- The on-site visit might have identified issues not reflected in public reporting

**Adjustment for uncertainty:**
Given these considerations, I should reduce my probability slightly to account for these tail risks. While the evidence strongly supports removal, the FATF process retains some opacity and unpredictability.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate for countries that have completed their action plans and received successful on-site visits, evaluating the specific evidence for South Africa, and accounting for potential blind spots, I arrive at a final probability of:

Final: 95%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is not the broad group of all countries on the FATF grey-list, but the more specific subset of countries that have been judged to have "substantially completed" their action plan and have been granted an on-site visit. This visit is the final verification step before a delisting decision. According to the research report, the vast majority of countries that reach this stage are subsequently removed from the list. The report suggests a historical success rate of 85-95% for this group.

Therefore, I will select a prior probability P(H) of **90%** that a country in this position will be delisted at the next plenary meeting. This corresponds to prior odds of 9 to 1 in favor of delisting.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
South Africa's situation appears to be stronger than the typical base case for a country at this stage. Key differentiators include:
*   **High-Level Commitment:** The South African government, particularly the National Treasury, has shown sustained and transparent political will to implement the required reforms.
*   **Strong Narrative:** The effort is framed as a crucial step in overcoming the legacy of "State Capture," providing a powerful political and social impetus for success that may not be present in all countries.
*   **Public-Private Consensus:** There is a strong and public consensus between the government and the business community (e.g., Business Leadership South Africa) that the requirements have been met and delisting is expected.

These factors suggest that South Africa is a particularly strong candidate for delisting, even compared to other countries that have reached the on-site visit stage.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The prior of 90% is already conditioned on South Africa having reached the on-site visit stage. The most critical new evidence is the outcome of that visit.

*   **Evidence (E):** Multiple media reports in late September 2025 indicating the on-site visit was successful and that assessors noted significant progress.
*   **Likelihood if Hypothesis is True (P(E | H)):** If South Africa is on track to be delisted (H), it is extremely likely that the on-site visit would be successful and that positive reports would emerge. A successful visit is a necessary condition for delisting. P(E | H) is very high, >95%.
*   **Likelihood if Hypothesis is False (P(E | ~H)):** If South Africa is *not* going to be delisted (~H), it is highly unlikely that reports about the crucial on-site visit would be uniformly positive. A negative outcome would likely stem from a failed visit, a last-minute political issue, or a decision to postpone. In any of these cases, we would expect negative leaks, cautionary statements, or at least silence, not positive reports. P(E | ~H) is very low, perhaps 10-20%.
*   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E | H) / P(E | ~H)):** The ratio is significantly greater than 1, indicating that this evidence provides a strong positive update to our belief. A conservative estimate for the LR would be around 5 to 10.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will update the prior odds using the new evidence.

*   **Prior Odds:** 9 to 1 (from the 90% base rate).
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** I will use a conservative LR of 5 to account for the fact that the reports are from media, not official FATF communications.
*   **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 9 × 5 = 45 to 1.
*   **Posterior Probability:** (Posterior Odds) / (1 + Posterior Odds) = 45 / 46 ≈ 97.8%.

The evidence strongly confirms the high prior, pushing the probability of delisting into the high 90s.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is very high, so I must critically examine potential failure modes.
*   **The Plenary is a "Black Box":** The final decision is made by consensus among member states. While the process is primarily technical, a political objection from a key member, though unlikely, cannot be entirely ruled out.
*   **Risk of Postponement:** The Plenary could acknowledge the excellent progress but decide to postpone the final decision to the next meeting (February 2026) to observe a longer period of sustained implementation. This would resolve the current question as "No," even if delisting is still the likely ultimate outcome. This is arguably the most plausible failure mode.
*   **Last-Minute Derailment:** A major, unforeseen scandal breaking between now and the meeting (October 20-24) could undermine the credibility of South Africa's reforms.

These risks are small but real. The calculated probability of ~98% implies only a 2% chance of failure. The risk of postponement or a political issue might be slightly higher than that. To account for these residual uncertainties inherent in the closed-door, consensus-based process, I will make a small downward adjustment to my final forecast. A 4% chance of failure seems a reasonable way to price in these tail risks.

### Final Forecast
The base rate for countries that have reached the on-site visit stage is already very high, around 90%. The subsequent evidence, particularly the reports of a successful on-site visit, is strongly positive and moves the probability significantly higher. After accounting for small but real risks such as a political block or a decision to postpone the vote, my final confidence remains very high.

Final: 96%
