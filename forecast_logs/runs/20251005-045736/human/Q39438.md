### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Review of Presidential Actions on National Security/Foreign Affairs:** Historically, the Supreme Court grants significant deference to the President in these areas. In cases where the President acts with arguable statutory authorization, the Court often upholds the action. A classic example is *Trump v. Hawaii* (2018), which upheld the travel ban.
    *   **Base Rate (Upholding President):** 60-70%.
    *   **Reasoning:** Derived from a qualitative review of major post-WWII cases involving presidential power in foreign affairs (*Dames & Moore v. Regan*, *Haig v. Agee*, *Trump v. Hawaii*). The Court is reluctant to second-guess the executive's judgment on what constitutes a national threat.
    *   **Limitations:** This class may be too broad. The current case involves tariffs—a tool traditionally under Congressional authority (Commerce Clause)—and rests on statutory interpretation, not inherent constitutional power.

2.  **Supreme Court Review of Executive Agency Actions on "Major Questions":** In recent years, the Court has increasingly used the "major questions doctrine" to strike down executive actions that have vast economic and political significance, arguing that Congress must speak clearly to delegate such authority. Key examples include *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) and *NFIB v. OSHA* (2022).
    *   **Base Rate (Striking Down Executive Action):** 60-70%.
    *   **Reasoning:** Based on the outcomes of prominent cases since ~2021 where the doctrine was invoked or central to the Court's reasoning. The current 6-3 conservative majority has championed this doctrine.
    *   **Limitations:** The IEEPA is a very broad delegation from Congress, potentially distinguishing it from the statutes at issue in other major questions cases. The national security context could also trigger deference that overrides major questions concerns.

3.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Cases with Unanimous Lower Court Agreement:** When multiple lower courts (especially across different circuits/specialized courts) agree on an outcome, even for different reasons, the Supreme Court reverses less frequently.
    *   **Base Rate (Affirming Lower Courts):** 65-75%.
    *   **Reasoning:** The unanimity among diverse judicial panels signals a strong legal foundation for the outcome, making a complete reversal less probable. Here, the Court of International Trade, a D.C. District Court, and the Federal Circuit all found the tariffs unlawful.
    *   **Limitations:** The Supreme Court takes cases precisely to resolve important issues and is not bound by lower court consensus. The differing legal rationales of the lower courts could provide the Supreme Court an opening to forge its own path.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-05-28** *V.O.S. Selections* ruling by CIT finds tariffs exceed IEEPA authority. — ↓ (Unlawful) — Establishes the first major judicial check, finding the tariffs don't "deal with" the threat.
*   **2025-05-29** *Learning Resources* ruling by D.C. District Court finds IEEPA doesn't authorize tariffs at all. — ↓ (Unlawful) — A broader and more fundamental challenge to the President's authority than the CIT ruling.
*   **2025-06-17** Plaintiffs in *Learning Resources* petition for cert before judgment. — (Neutral) — Signals urgency and high stakes, making a 2025 ruling more likely and a non-ruling less likely.
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms *V.O.S. Selections* decision. — ↓ (Unlawful) — A powerful appellate court confirmation strengthens the case against the tariffs, making a full reversal by SCOTUS less likely.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants cert and consolidates cases on an expedited schedule. — ↓ (No 2025 ruling) / ↑ (Mixed or Unlawful) — The speed confirms the Court sees this as a critical issue needing immediate resolution, making "No 2025 ruling" highly improbable. It also suggests the Court sees merit in the challenges.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's conservative majority is skeptical of broad executive authority over issues of major economic and political significance without explicit congressional authorization. Imposing tariffs on nearly all imports fits this description perfectly. (Large driver toward **Unlawful** or **Mixed**).
2.  **Textual Interpretation of IEEPA:** The core legal question is whether the IEEPA's text—authorizing the President to "regulate... any... importation... of... any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest"—includes the power to set tariffs (a tax). A narrow, textualist reading could find it does not. (Large driver toward **Unlawful**).
3.  **Deference on National Security:** The government's strongest argument is that the President has determined these are national emergencies, and the Court should not interfere. Justices Alito, and to some extent Roberts and Kavanaugh, have historically been deferential in this sphere. (Moderate driver toward **Lawful**).
4.  **Severability & Judicial Minimalism:** The cases challenge two distinct tariff regimes: the "trafficking tariffs" (Mexico, Canada, China) and the "reciprocal tariffs" (trade deficits). This provides a clear off-ramp for a narrow, mixed ruling. The Court could find the trafficking tariffs are plausibly linked to an emergency but the reciprocal tariffs are not. (Large driver toward **Mixed ruling**).
5.  **Non-Delegation Doctrine:** A more aggressive version of the major questions doctrine, favored by Justices Gorsuch and Thomas, holds that Congress cannot delegate its core legislative powers (like taxation) at all. An opinion leaning on this would be a sweeping rebuke of the tariffs. (Moderate driver toward **Unlawful**).
6.  **Stare Decisis & Precedent:** The government will rely heavily on precedents like *Dames & Moore* that interpreted IEEPA's predecessor statute broadly. Challengers will argue those precedents are distinguishable. How the Court treats these precedents will be critical. (Small driver toward **Lawful**).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Target of Power vs. Base Rate 1:** Unlike typical national security actions (e.g., sanctions, travel bans), these actions are tariffs—a form of tax explicitly granted to Congress in the Constitution. This strengthens the argument that the President is encroaching on legislative turf.
*   **Clarity of "Major Question" vs. Base Rate 2:** The sheer scale of the tariffs (from 2.5% to 27% average rate) and their economy-wide impact make this arguably a more "major question" than even the EPA's Clean Power Plan, increasing the likelihood the doctrine will be applied forcefully.
*   **Two Distinct Tariff Regimes:** The case presents two separate policies under one statute. This is unusual and provides a natural seam for a split decision, making a "Mixed ruling" far more plausible than in a typical case challenging a single executive order.
*   **Weak Nexus for "Reciprocal Tariffs":** The justification of a trade deficit as an "unusual and extraordinary threat" is legally novel and appears weak, making it an easy target for judicial skepticism compared to more traditional national security threats.
*   **Current Court's Philosophy:** The current 6-3 majority is significantly more skeptical of executive power in the domestic/economic sphere than the Courts that decided earlier deference cases, making historical base rates less reliable.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on deference to the executive (Base Rate 1), but with high uncertainty. E.g., P(Lawful)=40%, P(Unlawful)=30%, P(Mixed)=20%, P(Other/No)=10%, with an equivalent n of ~5, reflecting conflicting base rates.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓ Unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs provide a strong signal. (Large magnitude shift from Lawful to Unlawful/Mixed).
    *   ↓ The current Court's robust application of the "major questions doctrine" is a poor fit for the government's case. (Large magnitude shift from Lawful to Unlawful/Mixed).
    *   ↑ The existence of two distinct tariff regimes creates a clear path for a compromise. (Large magnitude shift from Unlawful/Lawful to **Mixed**).
    *   ↓ The "reciprocal tariffs" based on trade deficits have a particularly weak legal justification. (Moderate magnitude shift from Lawful to Unlawful/Mixed).
    *   ↓ The expedited schedule makes "No 2025 ruling" and "Other ruling" extremely unlikely. (Large magnitude shift away from these options).
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes away from "Tariffs lawful." The posterior should be heavily concentrated on **Mixed ruling** and **Tariffs unlawful**, with Mixed ruling likely being the plurality outcome due to the clean opportunity to split the difference on the two tariff types.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Lawful/Mixed):**
    *   Oral argument questions (Nov 2025) from Roberts, Kavanaugh, or Barrett focusing on the plain text of IEEPA and the President's unique role in identifying threats.
    *   Government's brief effectively analogizing these tariffs to other accepted uses of IEEPA, like import bans.
    *   Amicus briefs from former national security officials supporting the President's authority.
    *   Questions at oral argument distinguishing the trafficking tariffs from the reciprocal tariffs, signaling a potential split.

*   **DOWN indicators (favoring Unlawful/Mixed):**
    *   Oral argument questions from a majority of justices pressing the Solicitor General on a "limiting principle" for presidential power under

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful**: Historically, the Supreme Court has shown deference to presidential actions in national security and foreign affairs, with a base rate of 60-70% for upholding such actions. However, this case involves tariffs, traditionally under Congressional authority, which complicates the base rate.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: The "major questions doctrine" has been increasingly used to strike down executive actions with significant economic impact, with a base rate of 60-70% for striking down such actions. The current conservative majority has championed this doctrine.

- **Mixed ruling**: The presence of two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking tariffs and reciprocal tariffs) provides a natural seam for a split decision, making a mixed ruling plausible. Historical data on mixed rulings is less clear, but the unique circumstances suggest a base rate around 20-30%.

- **Other ruling**: Historically, the Supreme Court rarely issues rulings that do not address the merits in high-profile cases, suggesting a low base rate of around 5-10%.

- **No 2025 ruling**: Given the expedited schedule and the Court's agreement to hear the case, the likelihood of no ruling by the end of 2025 is very low, with a base rate of around 5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The case involves presidential action under a national security statute (IEEPA), similar to past cases where the Court has deferred to the executive.

- **Differences**: The tariffs are a form of tax, traditionally under Congressional authority, and the case involves significant economic impact, aligning with the "major questions doctrine."

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Unanimous lower court rulings**: Both the Court of International Trade and the D.C. District Court found the tariffs unlawful, suggesting a strong legal foundation against the tariffs. This evidence strongly supports "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling."

- **Major questions doctrine**: The Court's conservative majority has applied this doctrine robustly, suggesting a likelihood of striking down the tariffs.

- **Two distinct tariff regimes**: The presence of trafficking tariffs and reciprocal tariffs provides a clear path for a mixed ruling.

- **Expedited schedule**: The Supreme Court's decision to hear the case on an expedited schedule reduces the likelihood of "No 2025 ruling."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Prior odds**: Start with a prior centered on deference to the executive (Base Rate 1), but with high uncertainty.

- **Evidence mapping**: The unanimous lower court rulings and the major questions doctrine strongly push away from "Tariffs lawful." The presence of two distinct tariff regimes increases the likelihood of a "Mixed ruling."

- **Net effect**: The evidence strongly supports "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling," with "Mixed ruling" likely being the plurality outcome due to the opportunity to split the difference on the two tariff types.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence check**: Consider the possibility of the Court deferring to the executive on national security grounds, though this is less likely given the economic impact.

- **Alternative scenarios**: The Court could issue a narrow ruling focusing on the specific statutory language of IEEPA, potentially leading to a mixed outcome.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 15%  
Tariffs unlawful: 35%  
Mixed ruling: 40%  
Other ruling: 5%  
No 2025 ruling: 5%  

These probabilities reflect the strong legal challenges to the tariffs, the Court's recent application of the major questions doctrine, and the unique opportunity for a mixed ruling due to the distinct tariff regimes.

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option:

**Tariffs lawful (25%):**
- Historically, SCOTUS grants significant deference to the President on national security matters
- In cases like *Trump v. Hawaii* (2018), *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981), the Court upheld executive actions under similar emergency powers
- IEEPA explicitly grants the President broad authority to regulate imports during declared emergencies

**Tariffs unlawful (35%):**
- The current 6-3 conservative Court has increasingly limited executive power via the "major questions doctrine"
- Recent cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) show skepticism of broad agency interpretations
- All lower courts (CIT, DC District, Federal Circuit) ruled against the tariffs
- Tariffs are traditionally Congress's domain under the Commerce Clause

**Mixed ruling (30%):**
- The case involves two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking vs. reciprocal)
- The Court often seeks narrower rulings when possible
- The trafficking tariffs have a stronger national security nexus than the reciprocal tariffs

**Other ruling (5%):**
- Procedural dismissals are possible but rare in expedited cases
- The Court granted cert and consolidated cases, indicating intent to rule on merits

**No 2025 ruling (5%):**
- Extremely unlikely given the expedited schedule with arguments in November 2025
- The Court specifically set a timeline for a 2025 decision

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other national security cases, the President invoked statutory authority (IEEPA)
- Like other major questions cases, this involves significant economic impact
- Like other expedited cases, the Court has signaled urgency

**Key differences:**
- The scale of these tariffs is unprecedented under IEEPA
- Two distinct tariff regimes with different justifications are being challenged
- The "reciprocal tariffs" based on trade deficits stretch the definition of "emergency" further than previous cases
- Unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs (though with different reasoning)
- The Court's current 6-3 conservative majority is more skeptical of executive power than previous Courts

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs lawful":**
- IEEPA's text authorizes the President to "regulate... any... importation... of... any property"
- P(E|H) = High; P(E|~H) = Medium (text is broad but ambiguous on tariffs specifically)
- Historical precedent of judicial deference on national security
- P(E|H) = High; P(E|~H) = Low (deference is common in national security cases)

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs unlawful":**
- Unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs
- P(E|H) = Very Low; P(E|~H) = High (unusual to have such consensus against)
- Current Court's emphasis on major questions doctrine
- P(E|H) = Low; P(E|~H) = High (Court has consistently applied this doctrine)
- Tariffs as taxes traditionally fall under Congress's authority
- P(E|H) = Low; P(E|~H) = High (constitutional structure argument)

**Evidence favoring "Mixed ruling":**
- Two distinct tariff regimes with different justifications
- P(E|H) = Very High; P(E|~H) = Medium (provides clean opportunity for compromise)
- Trafficking tariffs have stronger emergency nexus than reciprocal tariffs
- P(E|H) = Very High; P(E|~H) = Medium (Court can distinguish between them)
- Court's preference for narrower rulings when possible
- P(E|H) = High; P(E|~H) = Medium (judicial minimalism principle)

**Evidence against "No 2025 ruling":**
- Expedited schedule with November arguments
- P(E|H) = Very Low; P(E|~H) = Very High (schedule designed for 2025 resolution)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on the strongest evidence: the unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs.

For "Tariffs lawful":
- Prior: 25%
- Likelihood ratio: P(unanimous lower court rulings|Tariffs lawful) / P(unanimous lower court rulings|Tariffs not lawful) ≈ 0.1/0.8 = 0.125
- Prior odds: 0.25/0.75 = 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.33 × 0.125 = 0.04125
- Posterior probability: 0.04125/(1+0.04125) ≈ 4%

This seems too extreme. Let's adjust for the fact that the Supreme Court often takes cases to reverse lower courts:
- Revised likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.7 = 0.43
- Posterior odds: 0.33 × 0.43 = 0.14
- Posterior probability: 0.14/(1+0.14) ≈ 12%

Now updating on the existence of two distinct tariff regimes:
- Prior for "Mixed ruling": 30%
- Likelihood ratio: P(two distinct regimes|Mixed ruling) / P(two distinct regimes|Not mixed ruling) ≈ 0.9/0.4 = 2.25
- Prior odds: 0.3/0.7 = 0.43
- Posterior odds: 0.43 × 2.25 = 0.97
- Posterior probability: 0.97/(1+0.97) ≈ 49%

Updating on the expedited schedule for "No 2025 ruling":
- Prior: 5%
- Likelihood ratio: P(expedited schedule|No 2025 ruling) / P(expedited schedule|Will rule in 2025) ≈ 0.05/0.95 = 0.05
- Prior odds: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- Posterior odds: 0.053 × 0.05 = 0.00265
- Posterior probability: 0.00265/(1+0.00265) ≈ 0.3%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the Court's willingness to split the difference between tariff regimes
- The Court could find a narrower ground for decision that doesn't fit neatly into the options
- I might be underestimating the Court's deference to the executive on national security
- The Court's composition and jurisprudential approach has shifted significantly, making historical patterns less reliable

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would give more weight to "Tariffs unlawful" (50%) and less to "Mixed ruling" (30%). The argument would be that the Court's recent jurisprudence on executive power suggests they'll apply the major questions doctrine robustly, and the unanimous lower court rulings provide cover for a broad ruling against the tariffs.

**Rebuttal:**
While the Court has limited executive power in domestic regulation, it has been more deferential on foreign affairs and national security. The clean division between trafficking and reciprocal tariffs provides an obvious compromise that would allow the Court to both check executive overreach (on reciprocal tariffs) while respecting national security concerns (on trafficking tariffs).

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming:
- "Tariffs lawful" probability: 12%
- "Tariffs unlawful" probability: 35% 
- "Mixed ruling" probability: 49%
- "Other ruling" probability: 3%
- "No 2025 ruling" probability: 1%

Total: 100%

## 7. Final Forecast

Tariffs lawful: 12%
Tariffs unlawful: 35%
Mixed ruling: 49%
Other ruling: 3%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
(sum 100%)

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will consider three relevant reference classes:

1.  **Deference to the President in Foreign Affairs/National Security:** Historically, the Supreme Court often defers to the President's judgment in these areas. Cases like *Trump v. Hawaii* suggest a base rate of roughly 60-70% for the Court upholding the President's action.
2.  **The Major Questions Doctrine:** A more recent trend from the current 6-3 conservative majority is to strike down executive actions of vast economic and political significance unless Congress has provided exceptionally clear authorization. This suggests a base rate of 60-70% for *striking down* the executive action.
3.  **Affirmance of Unanimous Lower Courts:** When multiple lower courts agree on an outcome, even for different reasons, the Supreme Court is more likely to affirm. Here, the Court of International Trade, a D.C. District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit all found the tariffs unlawful. This suggests a base rate of 65-75% for affirming the lower courts (i.e., ruling the tariffs unlawful).

These base rates are in direct conflict. The Major Questions Doctrine and the lower court agreement seem more pertinent to the current Supreme Court's jurisprudence than the older deference cases, especially as this case involves tariffs (a power textually granted to Congress). Therefore, I will start with a blended prior that leans toward the tariffs being found unlawful but acknowledges the countervailing deference principle.

*   **Initial Prior:** P(Unlawful): 50%, P(Lawful): 30%, P(Mixed): 15%, P(Other/No Ruling): 5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
This case has several unique features that distinguish it from the general reference classes:

*   **Tariffs vs. Other Powers:** The President's action is the imposition of tariffs, a form of taxation and regulation of commerce explicitly delegated to Congress in the Constitution. This makes judicial deference less likely than in areas like immigration or sanctions where presidential authority is more established. This weakens the "deference" base rate.
*   **Two Distinct Policies:** The case challenges two separate tariff regimes: the "trafficking tariffs" (on Mexico, Canada, China) and the "reciprocal tariffs" (based on trade deficits). This structure is unusual and provides a clear opportunity for a split decision, making a "Mixed ruling" inherently more plausible than in a case challenging a single, monolithic policy.
*   **Weak Justification for Reciprocal Tariffs:** The legal basis for declaring a trade deficit an "unusual and extraordinary threat" under IEEPA is novel and appears weak, making it an easy target for judicial skepticism compared to the more conventional (though still debatable) threat of drug trafficking.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate key pieces of evidence and their impact on the probabilities:

*   **Evidence:** The existence of two distinct and severable tariff regimes (trafficking vs. reciprocal).
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This evidence makes a "Mixed ruling" highly likely. The Court can practice judicial minimalism by striking down the weaker "reciprocal tariffs" while potentially upholding the "trafficking tariffs" under a more deferential standard. The probability of this evidence given a Mixed ruling, P(E | Mixed), is very high, whereas it is lower for a clean-sweep "Lawful" or "Unlawful" ruling. This evidence strongly shifts probability *toward* the "Mixed ruling" option.

*   **Evidence:** The current Supreme Court's robust application of the Major Questions Doctrine.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** Imposing tariffs on nearly all U.S. trade partners is a quintessential "major question." This doctrine strongly suggests the Court will require a crystal-clear statement from Congress, which the broad text of IEEPA may not provide. This evidence makes a full "Tariffs lawful" ruling very unlikely. The likelihood P(E | Lawful) is low, while P(E | Unlawful or Mixed) is high. This shifts probability *away* from "Lawful".

*   **Evidence:** The Court granted review on an expedited schedule with arguments in November 2025.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This signals the Court's view that the issue is urgent and requires a swift resolution. This makes a procedural dodge ("Other ruling") or a failure to decide in the term unlikely. However, the resolution deadline is January 1, 2026, which is a very tight turnaround from a November argument. This makes "No 2025 ruling" a non-trivial possibility, as a complex opinion could easily be released in January or February 2026. This evidence primarily shifts probability *away* from "Other ruling" but slightly *increases* the chance of "No 2025 ruling" due to the tight timeline.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
Let's conceptually update the prior based on the evidence.

1.  **Start with Prior:** P(Unlawful): 50%, P(Lawful): 30%, P(Mixed): 15%, P(Other/No): 5%.
2.  **Apply Major Questions Doctrine:** This evidence severely damages the "Lawful" option. I will shift significant probability mass from "Lawful" to "Unlawful" and "Mixed". For example, P(Lawful) might drop from 30% to 10%, with the 20 points being redistributed.
3.  **Apply "Two Policies" Evidence:** This is the strongest piece of evidence. It provides a natural off-ramp for the Court. This dramatically increases the probability of "Mixed ruling," drawing probability primarily from the "Unlawful" and "Lawful" categories. A clean sweep becomes less likely when a simple way to split the difference exists. This makes "Mixed ruling" the most probable outcome.
4.  **Consider Timeline:** The expedited schedule makes a merits ruling likely, but the tight Nov-Dec timeline means a ruling slipping into early 2026 is plausible. This warrants a small but significant probability for "No 2025 ruling".

After these updates, the posterior distribution is concentrated on "Mixed ruling" and "Tariffs unlawful," with "Mixed" having a slight edge due to the structure of the case. "Tariffs lawful" becomes a remote possibility.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast favors a "Mixed ruling." The strongest alternative is a clean-sweep "Tariffs unlawful" ruling. This could happen if the Court adopts the D.C. District Court's broad reasoning that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs at all, as tariffs are a form of tax reserved for Congress. This is a simple, bright-line rule that would appeal to textualist justices and would obviate the need to analyze the specifics of each tariff regime. This argument is strong enough that "Tariffs unlawful" should be considered nearly as likely as a "Mixed ruling."

Conversely, I might be underestimating the "deference" argument. The Court could decide that the IEEPA's text is so broad that it clearly delegates this authority, and that questioning the President's declaration of an emergency is a political question beyond the Court's purview. While this runs counter to recent trends, it remains a possibility.

Finally, the tight timeline for a decision before January 1, 2026, is a key uncertainty. A complex and divided opinion could easily take more than the ~7 weeks between argument and the new year to write. I have assigned 5% to this, which seems reasonable.

### 6. Final Normalization
I will adjust my final probabilities to reflect the close race between "Mixed" and "Unlawful," the low probability of "Lawful," and the small but real chances of a non-merits or delayed outcome.

*   **Mixed ruling:** 45% (Slightly favored as it represents a path of judicial minimalism).
*   **Tariffs unlawful:** 40% (A very close second, representing a broader but legally clean ruling).
*   **Tariffs lawful:** 7% (A small chance, reflecting a highly deferential outcome).
*   **No 2025 ruling:** 5% (Reflects the tight timeline).
*   **Other ruling:** 3% (Reflects the small chance of a procedural dismissal).

The sum is 45 + 40 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 100%.

Tariffs lawful: 7%
Tariffs unlawful: 40%
Mixed ruling: 45%
Other ruling: 3%
No 2025 ruling: 5%
