### Reference class & base rates
1.  **GVP Historical Year-End Counts (2015-2024):** The most direct reference class is the number of erupting volcanoes reported by the GVP at the end of each recent year. While precise year-end data requires database queries, the GVP's public statements and annual summaries consistently support a range. The background note's "typically 40-50 erupting volcanoes" is a good starting point, though weekly reports in recent years often show numbers in the upper end of this range or slightly above. A plausible base rate from this class is a range of **45-55 volcanoes**. This is derived from the stated typical range, adjusted slightly upwards to reflect recent observations of weekly counts.
2.  **All GVP Weekly/Monthly Reports (2020-Present):** A broader reference class includes all reporting periods, not just year-end. This captures the system's overall variability. This data shows a stable process with numbers fluctuating, but rarely straying far from the mean. The base rate is a distribution centered around **48-52 volcanoes**, with a standard deviation of approximately 3-5. This class is useful for understanding the system's natural churn and equilibrium.
3.  **Number of Volcanoes with Confirmed Eruptions in a Calendar Year:** This is a much larger number and serves as an upper bound. The GVP reported 58 volcanoes with confirmed eruptions as of September 19, 2025. In recent full years (e.g., 2023, 2024), this number has been around 70-80. This class is not a direct predictor but helps contextualize the ~50 "currently erupting" as a subset of all recently active volcanoes.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-30** Weekly GVP report confirms continued activity at multiple volcanoes (Dukono, Lewotobi, etc.). → (neutral) — This indicates the system is in a state of dynamic equilibrium, with persistent eruptions maintaining the count, matching the base rate expectation.
*   **2025-09-19** GVP reports 58 different volcanoes have erupted so far in 2025, with 21 being new eruptions. → (neutral) — The rate of new eruptions (~2.3/month) appears normal. This churn (new eruptions replacing those that cease) is a core feature of the stable base rate.
*   **2025-07-17** GVP completes a database update, including current eruptions. → (neutral) — These periodic data reviews ensure data quality but do not signal a fundamental shift in volcanic activity. They represent administrative process, not geological change.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **New Eruption Onset:** A previously dormant volcano begins erupting. This is the primary driver for increasing the count. (Moderate impact per event: +1)
2.  **Eruption Cessation:** An active volcano ceases all eruptive activity. Due to the 3-month reporting rule, its removal from the list is delayed, creating inertia. (Moderate impact per event: -1, with lag)
3.  **Persistent Eruptions:** A significant number of volcanoes (e.g., Stromboli, Dukono, Erebus) are in a state of near-continuous eruption for years or decades. These form a stable floor for the count. (Large stabilizing impact)
4.  **Major Tectonic Events:** A very large earthquake (>8.0 M) could potentially trigger or alter activity at nearby volcanoes, though the link is complex and not guaranteed. (Low probability, potentially moderate impact)
5.  **GVP Reporting & Data Reclassification:** The number is a product of a human-maintained database. A change in definition, confirmation of a previously unverified eruption, or a data cleanup could alter the count without any change in geology. (Small to moderate impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **High Stability:** The current situation is notable for its lack of anomalies. There are no reports of unusual swarms of activity, major tectonic shifts, or other phenomena that would suggest a deviation from the historical mean.
*   **Recency of Data:** We are forecasting with less than three months to resolution. The current number of erupting volcanoes is a very strong signal for the year-end number due to the system's inertia (especially the 3-month rule for cessation). This is different from forecasting 12+ months out.
*   **No Apparent Reporting Lags:** The GVP sources indicate regular updates through late September 2025. There is no evidence of a significant backlog of eruption confirmations that could suddenly inflate the number.
*   **Dominance of Persistent Eruptions:** The list of currently erupting volcanoes contains many "usual suspects" that are almost always active. This provides a solid, predictable base to the total count.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior distribution centered at **50**, with an equivalent strength of n=15, reflecting the stable historical base rate (range 45-55) and moderate confidence in its predictive power. A Poisson(50) or Normal(50, 4^2) would be appropriate.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ small) Consistent weekly reports of ongoing activity confirm the system's equilibrium and argue against a near-term drop in the count.
    *   (neutral) The rate of new eruptions in 2025 appears consistent with historical averages, providing no reason to expect a year-end surge.
    *   (neutral) The absence of major geological triggers (e.g., mega-quakes) supports a continuation of the status quo.
    *   (↓ small) The 3-month lag for removing volcanoes means any volcano that stops erupting between now and resolution will *still be on the list*. This caps the potential for the number to decrease significantly.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is strongly stabilizing and confirms the prior. The posterior should be very similar to the prior but with reduced variance. The forecast should be a tight distribution centered very close to the current observed number, likely in the **48-55** range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A major earthquake (>8.0 M) along the Pacific Ring of Fire.
    *   GVP reports confirming multiple *new* eruptions in a single week, especially in a new region.
    *   Simultaneous escalation of activity at several volcanoes that were previously at a low level.
    *   A GVP announcement of a data review that adds previously uncounted historical eruptions to the active list.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Coordinated reports of several persistently active volcanoes ceasing eruption (e.g., Stromboli, Yasur).
    *   Unusually low numbers of new eruption reports in the GVP weekly updates for several consecutive weeks.
    *   A period of extended, unusual quiet across a major volcanic arc (e.g., Aleutians, Indonesia).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Criteria are Key:** The forecast is about a number in a database, not a direct measure of physical reality. The resolution depends entirely on the GVP's reporting at a specific time.
*   **The 3-Month Rule:** This is the most important "gotcha." It creates significant inertia. A volcano that stops erupting on October 1, 2025, will still be counted as "erupting" at the end of December. This makes a sharp decrease in the number very unlikely.
*   **Data Artifacts:** The final number could be influenced by last-minute data updates, re-classifications, or corrections by the GVP team that are unrelated to on-the-ground volcanic activity.
*   **Defining "Eruption":** The GVP has specific criteria for what constitutes an eruption (e.g., emission of ash, lava, etc.). Minor activity like gas venting or seismic unrest does not count. The Katmai source, for example, describes re

To forecast the number of volcanoes erupting at the end of 2025, we will follow the structured approach outlined:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from the Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program's historical data, which indicates that typically 40-50 volcanoes are erupting at any given time. Recent data suggests a slightly higher range of 45-55 volcanoes. Therefore, a reasonable base rate is centered around 50 volcanoes, with a standard deviation of approximately 4, reflecting the natural variability observed in the data.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is consistent with the historical base rate, as there are no significant deviations or anomalies in volcanic activity reported. The system's inertia, due to the 3-month rule for cessation, supports the stability of this base rate.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The ongoing activity at multiple volcanoes and the consistent rate of new eruptions align with the historical average, supporting the base rate.
   - The absence of major tectonic events or unusual volcanic activity suggests no significant upward or downward pressure on the count.
   - The 3-month rule for cessation limits the potential for a decrease in the number of erupting volcanoes.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered at 50 volcanoes, the evidence suggests maintaining this center with a slightly reduced variance due to the stability of recent reports.
   - The posterior distribution remains centered around 50, with a narrowed range of 48-55 volcanoes, reflecting the strong stabilizing evidence.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks includes the potential for a major tectonic event, which could increase the count, but this is deemed low probability.
   - The possibility of data reclassification or reporting anomalies is acknowledged but unlikely to significantly alter the count.
   - An alternative forecast might consider a slightly wider range, but given the stability of the evidence, the current forecast is robust.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the calibrated percentiles for the number of erupting volcanoes at the end of 2025 are as follows:

P10: 48  
P20: 49  
P40: 50  
P60: 51  
P80: 52  
P90: 53

# Forecast: Number of Volcanoes Erupting at End of 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior distribution, I'll use the typical number of erupting volcanoes as reported by the Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program. The background information states that "there are typically 40-50 erupting volcanoes at any given time."

Looking more closely at this reference class:
- The GVP considers a volcano to be erupting if it has had eruptive events within the last 3 months
- Recent weekly reports suggest numbers often in the upper end of the 40-50 range or slightly above
- This creates a base rate centered around 48-50 volcanoes
- The variance appears to be relatively small, with a standard deviation of approximately 3-4 volcanoes

I'll use a prior distribution centered at 49 volcanoes, with a standard deviation of 4.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The current volcanic monitoring system remains unchanged
- The definition of "erupting" (activity within 3 months) remains consistent
- The global tectonic environment appears stable with no major anomalies reported

**Differences from base case:**
- We are forecasting with less than 3 months until resolution (October to December 2025)
- This creates significant inertia in the system - volcanoes that stop erupting now will still count at year-end due to the 3-month rule
- Recent reports indicate ongoing activity at multiple volcanoes (Dukono, Lewotobi, etc.)
- The research indicates 58 different volcanoes have erupted so far in 2025, with 21 being new eruptions

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Current activity levels**
- The weekly reports through September 30, 2025 show continued activity at multiple volcanoes
- This suggests the system is in a state of dynamic equilibrium
- Likelihood ratio: Neutral (1:1) - consistent with the base rate

**Evidence 2: New eruptions in 2025**
- 21 new eruptions over approximately 9 months equals about 2.3 new eruptions per month
- This rate appears normal and suggests 6-7 more new eruptions might occur before year-end
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors higher values (1.2:1)

**Evidence 3: The 3-month rule for cessation**
- Any volcano that stops erupting after October 1, 2025 will still be counted as "erupting" at year-end
- This creates a floor effect and makes sharp decreases unlikely
- Likelihood ratio: Strongly disfavors lower values (1:3)

**Evidence 4: Absence of major geological triggers**
- No reports of major earthquakes or unusual tectonic activity that might trigger multiple new eruptions
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly disfavors very high values (1:1.2)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 49 with SD=4, I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update based on the 3-month rule (Evidence 3):**
- This significantly reduces the probability of values below 45
- It shifts the distribution upward by approximately 2 points
- New posterior mean: 51
- The variance is reduced slightly due to the floor effect

**Update based on new eruption rate (Evidence 2):**
- The slightly above-average new eruption rate adds a small upward pressure
- This shifts the mean up by approximately 1 point
- Updated posterior mean: 52
- Variance remains similar

**Update based on absence of triggers (Evidence 4):**
- This caps the upper tail slightly
- The mean remains at 52
- The variance is reduced slightly, particularly in the upper tail

Final posterior distribution:
- Mean: 52 volcanoes
- Standard deviation: approximately 3.5 volcanoes
- Shape: slightly right-skewed due to the floor effect from the 3-month rule

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for a cluster of new eruptions in the final months of 2025
- The 3-month rule creates inertia, but I might be overestimating its effect
- I haven't accounted for potential data revisions by the GVP that could affect the count

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Lower scenario (45-48):** Several currently erupting volcanoes could have stopped in September, and the GVP might conduct a database cleanup that removes some borderline cases.
- **Higher scenario (55-60):** A series of new eruptions could occur in October-December, potentially triggered by undetected tectonic activity.

**Adjustments:**
- I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these uncertainties
- I'll maintain the slight right skew due to the 3-month rule's floor effect
- I'll ensure my P10-P90 range is wide enough to capture reasonable tail scenarios

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 47
P20: 49
P40: 51
P60: 53
P80: 55
P90: 57

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the number of erupting volcanoes at any given time, as tracked by the Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program (GVP). The background information and research report provide strong guidance here.
- The background states there are "typically 40-50 erupting volcanoes at any given time."
- The research report refines this, noting that recent weekly counts (2020-present) suggest a distribution centered around **48-52 volcanoes**, with a standard deviation of approximately 3-5.

Based on this, I will select a prior distribution that is Normal with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 4, denoted as N(50, 4²). This distribution has its central mass (~68%) between 46 and 54, and ~95% of its mass between 42 and 58, which aligns well with the provided historical data and typical ranges.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is highly similar to the base case, which is a key piece of information.
- **Similarities:** The research report notes "high stability" and a "normal" rate of new eruptions for 2025. This indicates that the underlying geological system is in its typical state of dynamic equilibrium, where new eruptions are balanced by cessations over time.
- **Differences:** The primary difference is the **short time horizon**. The forecast is for the end of 2025, and the current date is October 5, 2025. With less than three months to resolution, the system has very little time to deviate significantly from its current state. The current number of erupting volcanoes is therefore a much stronger predictor than it would be for a forecast made a year in advance.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their impact on the prior distribution.

- **Evidence 1: System Stability:** The research report confirms that there are no major tectonic events, unusual swarms of activity, or other anomalies. This is strong evidence against tail events (very high or very low numbers) and supports a distribution concentrated around the mean. This evidence significantly reduces the likelihood of outcomes far from the 45-55 range.
- **Evidence 2: The 3-Month Reporting Rule:** The GVP "considers a volcano to be erupting if it has had eruptive events within the last 3 months." This rule creates significant inertia. For the end-of-2025 count, any volcano that erupts on or after October 1, 2025, will be included. This makes a sharp *decrease* in the number of volcanoes very unlikely, as most currently active volcanoes will either erupt again or their 3-month window will not have expired. This evidence pushes the lower tail of the distribution up.
- **Evidence 3: Churn Rate:** The rate of new eruptions in 2025 is normal (~2.3/month). Over the remaining ~3 months, we can expect a number of new eruptions, likely following a Poisson distribution with a mean around 7 (2.3 * 3). This is balanced by a similar rate of cessations. The net effect of this churn over a short period is small fluctuations around the current number.

The combined effect of this evidence is to strongly confirm the prior's central tendency (around 50) while reducing its variance. The system is behaving as expected, and the short time frame limits the potential for random drift.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** N(50, 4²)
- **Likelihood:** The evidence strongly suggests the system is in its equilibrium state and will remain there for the next three months. The likelihood function, therefore, peaks very strongly at the current number of erupting volcanoes (which is consistent with our prior mean of 50). The main source of uncertainty is the random churn (new eruptions minus cessations) over the next three months. The variance of this net change can be modeled as the sum of variances of two Poisson processes (one for new eruptions, one for cessations), which would be roughly `Var(Poisson(7)) + Var(Poisson(7)) = 7 + 7 = 14`. The standard deviation of the change is `sqrt(14) ≈ 3.7`.
- **Posterior:** Combining the prior N(50, 4²) with this evidence-based model of change N(0, 3.7²) results in a posterior distribution that is very close to the prior, as the evidence simply confirms the system's stable nature. The posterior mean remains ~50, and the standard deviation remains ~4.
    - Posterior Mean ≈ 50
    - Posterior Standard Deviation ≈ 4

My final posterior distribution is N(50, 4²), reflecting a high degree of confidence that the number will be very close to the recent historical average due to the system's observed stability and the short forecast horizon.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider what could make this forecast wrong.
- **Alternative Scenario 1: Tail Risk (High).** A major tectonic event (e.g., a >8.5M earthquake on the Pacific Ring of Fire) could trigger multiple new eruptions simultaneously, pushing the number towards 60. While a very low probability event, its impact would be significant.
- **Alternative Scenario 2: Tail Risk (Low).** A data artifact or re-classification by the GVP could cause a sudden drop. For instance, if they review the data for several persistently active volcanoes and decide their activity no longer meets the definition of an "eruption," the count could drop by 3-5 unexpectedly.
- **Alternative Scenario 3: Mean Shift.** The recent data showing numbers in the upper end of the 40-50 range (i.e., 48-52) might not be noise but a new, slightly higher equilibrium. If so, my median of 50 might be slightly too low, and a median of 51 or 52 could be more accurate.

To account for these possibilities, particularly the slight chance of a higher mean and the low-probability tail risks, I will maintain the standard deviation of 4 from my prior. This creates a P10-P90 range of [45, 55], which feels robust. It correctly captures the idea that a number outside 40-60 is extremely unlikely, while a number between 47 and 53 is very likely. The symmetric distribution around 50 remains the most defensible position given the lack of evidence for a directional trend.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final forecast is based on a Normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 4.

P10: 45
P20: 47
P40: 49
P60: 51
P80: 53
P90: 55
