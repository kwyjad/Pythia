### Reference class & base rates
*   **EA-aligned Non-Profit Startups:** Organizations in the Effective Altruism ecosystem often start with a small founding team (1-3 people). If they demonstrate traction and align with funder priorities, they can experience rapid, non-linear growth. Conditional on surviving the first two years, a rough base rate for such an organization having more than two full-time employees (FTEs) by its fourth year is **60-75%**. This is higher than typical non-profits due to access to large, concentrated funding pools.
*   **Niche Policy Think Tanks (Geneva):** Small, specialized think tanks in policy hubs like Geneva often prioritize expertise over size. They can be influential with a core team of 3-10 experts. The failure rate for new think tanks is significant in the first few years. For those that establish themselves, crossing a 2-FTE threshold is a key viability milestone. The base rate for a successful new think tank having >2 FTEs after four years is likely **50-65%**.
*   **Limitations:** Both classes are imperfect. The Simon Institute (SI) is a hybrid, benefiting from the EA funding model but operating in the traditional think tank space. The base rates are estimates based on qualitative observation of these sectors, as hard data on staff growth for such specific entities is scarce.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-05-01] 2024 Annual Report published — ↑ — Details a high level of activity throughout 2024 (informing frameworks, building alliances, expert guidance), making a team of ≤2 FTEs highly improbable. This is the strongest recent evidence.
*   [2024-06-01] 2023 Annual Report published — ↑ — Highlighted that the team "grew" in 2023 and published two major UN reports, indicating successful early-stage scaling and impact well before 2025.
*   [2023-10-23] "Our Plans Until 2025" published — ↑ — Outlined an ambitious strategy focused on AI governance, a high-priority and well-funded area, signaling intent and capacity for continued operations and growth.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **EA Funder Support:** Access to large grants from EA-aligned funds (e.g., Long-Term Future Fund, Open Philanthropy) is the primary driver of growth. A single grant can fund multiple positions for several years. (Large)
*   **Relevance of AI Governance:** SI's focus on AI governance places it at the center of a major global policy conversation, increasing demand for its work and attractiveness to funders. (Large)
*   **Demonstrated Policy Traction:** Success, such as publishing UN reports, creates a feedback loop, enhancing reputation and unlocking further funding and collaboration opportunities, which in turn requires more staff. (Moderate)
*   **Leadership and Strategy:** The ability of the leadership to execute their strategic plan and navigate the complex multilateral environment is crucial for sustained operations and growth. (Moderate)
*   **Burnout/Turnover:** Small, mission-driven organizations can be prone to burnout. High turnover or the departure of a key founder could quickly reduce staff count below the threshold. (Small-to-Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Accelerated Traction:** Unlike a typical new think tank, SI published "major UN reports" within its first three years, suggesting unusually rapid access and influence.
*   **Hyper-Relevant Niche:** SI's focus on "governance of rapid technological change, with a specific focus on AI" is more timely and in-demand than the focus of a more generic public policy startup, increasing its growth potential.
*   **Concentrated Funding Model:** SI is part of the EA ecosystem, which has a different funding dynamic than traditional non-profits that rely on diversified, often smaller grants. This allows for faster scaling if key funders are convinced.
*   **Strategic Location:** Being based in Geneva is a significant advantage for its specific mission of influencing the multilateral system, providing direct access to the UN and other international bodies.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior of ~65% seems reasonable, derived from the reference classes of successful EA-aligned orgs and niche think tanks. This reflects a better-than-even chance of growth past the 2-FTE mark after four years (equivalent n ≈ 10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The 2024 Annual Report describes a scope of work (international frameworks, alliances, expert guidance) that strongly implies a team larger than two people was required to execute it.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The 2023 Annual Report explicitly states the team "grew" and had significant outputs (UN reports), suggesting the >2 FTE threshold was likely met or approached in 2023.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The 2023-2025 strategic plan shows ambition and focus on a high-growth area (AI governance), signaling intent to maintain or expand capacity.
    *   (→) The general environment remains favorable for AI governance work, with no new negative information presented.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is consistently and strongly positive. The updates should push the posterior significantly upward from an already favorable prior, landing in a high-confidence "Yes" region.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   New job postings on the SI website or EA-related job boards.
    *   Announcement of a new, major multi-year grant.
    *   Publication of a new major report or co-hosting a high-profile event.
    *   Mention of SI staff expansion in any blog posts or newsletters.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Key staff members announcing their departure on social media (e.g., LinkedIn).
    *   Website becoming static with no new updates or publications.
    *   Any public statement about funding difficulties or strategic consolidation.
    *   Removal of staff from their official "Team" page.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **FTE Definition:** The resolution hinges on "full-time equivalent" (35 hours/week). SI could operate with numerous part-time contractors or fellows, which might not sum to >2 FTEs, even with high output. The annual reports are unlikely to provide this level of detail.
*   **Reporting Lag:** The most recent source is the 2024 Annual Report, published in May 2025. This reflects the state of the organization over 9 months ago. A sudden funding shock or departure could have occurred since.
*   **"Abandoned" Clause:** While all evidence points to a thriving organization, an unforeseen catastrophic event (e.g., loss of all funding, scandal) could lead to abandonment, though this is a tail risk.
*   **Data Opacity:** Small, private non-profits are not required to disclose real-time staffing levels. The resolution may depend on a "best estimate" by moderators, introducing subjectivity.

**Final Research Summary:** The Simon Institute has shown a strong growth trajectory since its 2021 founding, achieving significant policy traction. The scope of their activities described in their 2024 annual report makes it highly probable they have operated with more than two full-time employees for some time and will continue to do so through the end of 2025.

To forecast whether the Simon Institute for Longterm Governance will have more than two full-time employees in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for the Simon Institute having more than two full-time employees by 2025 can be derived from two reference classes:
- **EA-aligned Non-Profit Startups:** These organizations often start small but can grow rapidly if they align with funder priorities. The base rate for such organizations having more than two FTEs by their fourth year is approximately **60-75%**.
- **Niche Policy Think Tanks (Geneva):** These think tanks often prioritize expertise over size, with a base rate of **50-65%** for having more than two FTEs after four years.

Given the Simon Institute's hybrid nature, benefiting from EA funding while operating in the think tank space, a reasonable prior probability is around **65%**. This reflects a better-than-even chance of growth past the 2-FTE mark after four years.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The Simon Institute shares characteristics with both reference classes, such as being a small, mission-driven organization with access to EA funding.
- **Differences:** The Institute has shown accelerated traction, publishing major UN reports within its first three years, and operates in a hyper-relevant niche (AI governance), which increases its growth potential compared to typical think tanks.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **2024 Annual Report:** Describes a high level of activity, suggesting a team larger than two people. This evidence strongly increases the probability.
- **2023 Annual Report:** Indicates team growth and significant outputs, suggesting the >2 FTE threshold was likely met or approached in 2023. This moderately increases the probability.
- **Strategic Plan for 2023-2025:** Shows ambition and focus on AI governance, signaling intent to maintain or expand capacity. This moderately increases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 65% probability translates to odds of 0.65 / 0.35 = 1.857.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** The evidence from the 2024 Annual Report is particularly strong, suggesting a likelihood ratio significantly greater than 1.
- **Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1.857 × (strong positive evidence) ≈ significantly higher odds.
- **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability is thus significantly higher than the prior, likely in the range of 85-90%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of unforeseen events such as funding shocks or key staff departures. However, the evidence of growth and strategic focus on AI governance mitigates these risks.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden funding shock or departure could reduce staff count, but given the current evidence, this seems unlikely.
- **Adjustments:** Given the strong evidence and the lack of significant negative indicators, the forecast remains robust.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, strong positive evidence, and the lack of significant negative indicators, the final forecast is:

Final: 90%

# Will the Simon Institute for Longterm Governance have more than two full-time employees in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for a relatively new think tank/policy organization having more than two full-time employees by 2025 (approximately 4 years after its founding).

I'll consider two relevant reference classes:
- EA-aligned organizations: These typically have access to concentrated funding and can scale quickly if they demonstrate value. For those that survive their first 2-3 years, the base rate of having >2 FTEs by year 4 is approximately 65-75%.
- Niche policy think tanks: Small specialized think tanks in policy hubs like Geneva often operate with small teams but need a minimum viable size to be effective. The base rate for successful ones having >2 FTEs after 4 years is approximately 50-65%.

The Simon Institute sits at the intersection of these reference classes, so I'll use a prior of 65%, which represents a better-than-even chance of growth past the 2-FTE threshold after four years of operation.

**Prior probability: 65%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other EA-aligned organizations, SI was founded with a specific mission related to longtermism
- Like other policy think tanks, it operates in a competitive space where credibility and expertise matter
- It follows a similar trajectory of starting small and potentially scaling based on demonstrated impact

**Differences from base case:**
- **Unusually rapid traction**: SI has published "major UN reports" within its first three years, suggesting faster-than-typical access and influence
- **Highly relevant focus**: SI's concentration on AI governance places it in an area of increasing global importance and funding
- **Strategic location advantage**: Being based in Geneva provides direct access to international institutions
- **Hybrid funding model**: SI benefits from both EA funding networks and potentially traditional policy/think tank funding sources

These differences generally suggest a higher probability of success and growth compared to the base case.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: 2024 Annual Report (published May 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If SI has >2 FTEs, they would almost certainly produce a comprehensive annual report describing multiple workstreams
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - A team of ≤2 FTEs would struggle to produce the scope of work described (international frameworks, alliances, expert guidance)
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5
- This evidence significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: 2023 Annual Report mentioning team growth**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Organizations growing beyond 2 FTEs would likely mention team growth in reports
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even small teams might mention "growth" that doesn't cross the 2 FTE threshold
- Likelihood ratio: ~2
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Strategic plan through 2025 focused on AI governance**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Organizations with >2 FTEs are more likely to produce detailed multi-year plans
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even small teams can produce ambitious plans
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.4
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 65% (odds of 65:35 or ~1.86:1)

First update (2024 Annual Report):
- Prior odds: 1.86:1
- Likelihood ratio: 4.5
- Posterior odds: 1.86 × 4.5 = 8.37:1
- Posterior probability: 8.37/(1+8.37) ≈ 89.3%

Second update (2023 Annual Report):
- Prior odds: 8.37:1
- Likelihood ratio: 2
- Posterior odds: 8.37 × 2 = 16.74:1
- Posterior probability: 16.74/(1+16.74) ≈ 94.4%

Third update (Strategic plan):
- Prior odds: 16.74:1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.4
- Posterior odds: 16.74 × 1.4 = 23.44:1
- Posterior probability: 23.44/(1+23.44) ≈ 95.9%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the significance of annual reports and strategic plans as evidence of team size
- The definition of "full-time equivalent" (35 hours/week) could be a complication if SI relies heavily on part-time staff or contractors
- I haven't accounted for potential funding shocks in the EA ecosystem that could affect SI's growth trajectory
- The research report doesn't mention any negative signals, which might create an overly optimistic picture

**Alternative scenarios:**
- SI could maintain high output with just 2 FTEs by leveraging extensive networks of collaborators and volunteers
- A key founder departure could reduce staff below the threshold
- SI might pivot to a different operational model with fewer core staff but more external collaborations

**Adjustment for uncertainty:**
Given these considerations, I should be somewhat less confident than my mathematical update suggests. The evidence is strong but not overwhelming, and there are plausible scenarios where SI operates with ≤2 FTEs despite its apparent success.

I'll adjust my forecast downward slightly to account for these uncertainties.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence about Simon Institute's growth and activities, and accounting for potential blind spots, I assess that there is a high probability that the Simon Institute for Longterm Governance will have more than two full-time employees in 2025.

Final: 92%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
*   **Event (H):** The Simon Institute for Longterm Governance (SI) will have more than two full-time employees (FTEs) in 2025.
*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is a hybrid of "EA-aligned Non-Profit Startups" and "Niche Policy Think Tanks." EA-aligned startups have access to concentrated funding and can scale quickly, while niche think tanks often grow more slowly. The research report suggests base rates of 60-75% and 50-65% respectively for crossing the >2 FTE threshold after four years, conditional on survival.
*   **Prior Probability:** Blending these, and giving weight to the advantageous EA funding model, a prior probability of **65%** is appropriate. This acknowledges that a successful organization of this type is more likely than not to grow beyond a small founding team.
*   **Prior Odds:** P(H) = 0.65, P(~H) = 0.35. Prior Odds = 0.65 / 0.35 ≈ 1.86 to 1.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** SI is a new, specialized, mission-driven organization, fitting the general profile of the reference class.
*   **Differences:** SI appears to be an unusually strong member of its class. Its focus on AI governance is extremely timely and attractive to funders. Its demonstrated ability to produce major UN reports within its first few years indicates accelerated traction and effectiveness compared to a typical new think tank. These factors suggest its probability of growth should be higher than the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The most critical piece of evidence is the 2024 Annual Report, published in May 2025.

*   **Evidence (E):** The 2024 Annual Report "details a high level of activity throughout 2024 (informing frameworks, building alliances, expert guidance)."
*   **P(E | H):** If SI had more than two FTEs, it is very likely they would be engaged in such a high level of activity. This evidence is highly consistent with the hypothesis being true.
*   **P(E | ~H):** If SI had two or fewer FTEs, it would be extremely difficult to sustain this breadth and depth of work. While not impossible for two exceptionally productive individuals, it is highly improbable.
*   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E | H) / P(E | ~H)):** This ratio is significantly greater than 1. A team of >2 FTEs is many times more likely to produce this output than a team of ≤2 FTEs. I estimate a conservative likelihood ratio of at least 10. This evidence strongly increases the probability of H.
*   **Other Evidence:** The 2023 report stating the team "grew" and the ambitious 2025 plans are consistent with this strong positive trajectory, reinforcing the main conclusion.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior Odds:** 1.86 to 1 (from 65% probability).
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** ~10 to 1.
*   **Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio**
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ 1.86 × 10 = 18.6 to 1.
*   **Posterior Probability = Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds)**
    *   Posterior Probability ≈ 18.6 / 19.6 ≈ 0.949.

The strong evidence of high operational capacity updates the prior from 65% to approximately 95%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The primary reason this forecast could be wrong is the "FTE Definition Trap." SI could have a core team of two principals (2.0 FTEs) and achieve high output by using numerous part-time contractors, fellows, or interns whose hours do not aggregate to a full additional FTE. This is a plausible model for a lean, modern think tank.
*   **Plausibility:** This scenario would allow SI to be highly productive while remaining just at or below the 2.0 FTE threshold. The resolution criteria's focus on a strict 35-hour/week FTE definition makes this a non-trivial risk.
*   **Other Risks:** A sudden, unannounced collapse or loss of funding between the end of 2024 and the present (October 2025) is a tail risk, but the lack of any negative indicators makes it unlikely.
*   **Adjustment:** The plausibility of the "FTE trap" scenario warrants caution against extreme certainty. A probability of 95% leaves a 5% chance for this and other unforeseen circumstances, which feels appropriate. The evidence for high activity is undeniable, but the exact translation to FTE count has a small amount of ambiguity.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for a successful organization of this type growing beyond two employees is favorable. The specific evidence for the Simon Institute is exceptionally strong, pointing to a high level of activity and impact that is very difficult to achieve with two or fewer full-time staff. The trajectory shown in their reports from 2023 and 2024 indicates sustained growth and execution. While there is a small possibility that the organization's structure relies heavily on non-FTE contractors, the most straightforward interpretation of the evidence is that they have surpassed the two-FTE threshold.

Final: 95%
