    To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, let's apply Bayesian reasoning to each option:
    
    ### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
    
    - **Tariffs lawful**: Historically, the Supreme Court has often deferred to presidential authority in matters of national security and foreign policy, but less so when it comes to economic measures like tariffs. A rough base rate might be around 20%, considering the general trend of judicial skepticism towards expansive executive economic powers without clear congressional authorization.
      
    - **Tariffs unlawful**: Given the lower courts' rulings against the tariffs and the historical tendency to limit executive overreach in economic matters, a base rate of 40% seems reasonable.
      
    - **Mixed ruling**: The Court often seeks compromise solutions, especially in complex cases with multiple issues. A base rate of 30% reflects this possibility.
      
    - **Other ruling**: The Supreme Court sometimes avoids ruling on the merits by dismissing cases on procedural grounds. A base rate of 5% accounts for this.
      
    - **No 2025 ruling**: Given the expedited schedule, it's unlikely the Court will not rule by the end of 2025. A base rate of 5% reflects this.
    
    ### 2. Comparison to Base Case
    
    - **Similarities**: The case involves executive power and national security, areas where the Court has historically shown deference.
      
    - **Differences**: The economic nature of tariffs and the clear rulings from lower courts against the tariffs suggest a higher likelihood of the Court ruling them unlawful.
    
    ### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
    
    - **Lower Court Rulings**: Both the Court of International Trade and the D.C. District Court ruled against the tariffs. This evidence strongly supports the "Tariffs unlawful" option.
      
    - **Expedited Supreme Court Review**: The urgency and consolidation of cases suggest the Court sees this as a significant issue, possibly increasing the likelihood of a mixed ruling.
      
    - **Political Composition**: The Federal Circuit's decision was split along partisan lines, which might influence the Supreme Court's decision, but the Court's composition and past rulings suggest a more nuanced approach.
    
    ### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
    
    - **Tariffs unlawful**: Prior odds = 0.4 / (1 - 0.4) = 0.67. Given strong lower court rulings, likelihood ratio > 1, say 2. Posterior odds = 0.67 * 2 = 1.34. Posterior probability = 1.34 / (1 + 1.34) ≈ 57%.
      
    - **Mixed ruling**: Prior odds = 0.3 / (1 - 0.3) = 0.43. Given the complexity and potential for compromise, likelihood ratio = 1. Posterior odds = 0.43. Posterior probability = 0.43 / (1 + 0.43) ≈ 30%.
      
    - **Tariffs lawful**: Prior odds = 0.2 / (1 - 0.2) = 0.25. Given the evidence, likelihood ratio < 1, say 0.5. Posterior odds = 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125. Posterior probability = 0.125 / (1 + 0.125) ≈ 11%.
      
    - **Other ruling**: Prior odds = 0.05 / (1 - 0.05) = 0.053. Likelihood ratio = 1. Posterior odds = 0.053. Posterior probability = 0.053 / (1 + 0.053) ≈ 5%.
      
    - **No 2025 ruling**: Prior odds = 0.05 / (1 - 0.05) = 0.053. Likelihood ratio < 1, say 0.5. Posterior odds = 0.053 * 0.5 = 0.0265. Posterior probability = 0.0265 / (1 + 0.0265) ≈ 3%.
    
    ### 5. Red Team Thinking
    
    - **Overconfidence**: The "Tariffs unlawful" probability might be too high given the Supreme Court's unpredictability.
      
    - **Alternative Scenarios**: Consider the possibility of a procedural dismissal or a delay in ruling.
      
    - **Adjustments**: Slightly increase "Mixed ruling" and "Other ruling" probabilities to account for these uncertainties.
    
    ### 6. Final Normalization
    
    Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.
    
    ### 7. Output Format
    
    Tariffs lawful: 11%  
    Tariffs unlawful: 55%  
    Mixed ruling: 27%  
    Other ruling: 5%  
    No 2025 ruling: 2%
