### Research Summary
The research presents an analysis of the probability of human extinction by the year 2100, estimating it to be between **1-4%** based on current consensus. It highlights historical extinction events, noting that while they provide context, the causes and scales differ significantly from contemporary risks. The reference class for this analysis includes existential threats such as advanced AI, pandemics, and nuclear conflicts, which are acknowledged but considered unlikely to result in total extinction. The resilience and adaptability of humans are emphasized as factors that have historically mitigated existential threats.

The research further distinguishes between status quo forces, such as global population growth, technological advancements, and international cooperation on existential risk management, and change drivers, which include potential risks from advanced AI, biotechnology, and climate change. Recent updates indicate that the Metaculus community estimates the extinction probability at **1-2%**, while Manifold Markets places it at **3-4%**. The research also outlines resolution criteria, stating that the question of extinction resolves as "Yes" only if no known biological humans are alive on January 1, 2100, and discusses disconfirming evidence regarding advanced AI, historical pandemics, and unforeseen technological threats.

The base rate for human extinction by 2100 is estimated at 1-4%. Current evidence, including technological advancements and international cooperation on existential risks, suggests a low probability of total extinction. However, potential risks from AI, biotechnology, and unforeseen threats require consideration. The Metaculus and Manifold Markets estimates align with the base rate, reinforcing a low probability. The likelihood ratio remains close to 1, as no new evidence significantly shifts the odds.
</likelihoods>
<bayes_likelihood_ratio>1.1</bayes_likelihood_ratio>
<bayes_posterior>0.022</bayes_posterior>
<stress_yes>
If advanced AI develops unchecked and leads to catastrophic outcomes, the probability could increase significantly. However, current trends in AI safety research and regulation aim to mitigate such risks.
</stress_yes>
<stress_no>
If international cooperation continues to strengthen and technological advancements further enhance human resilience, the probability of extinction could decrease even further.
</stress_no>

### Research Summary
The research examines the historical performance and future prospects of new AI labs in achieving leading status within two years of their founding. It highlights that historically, new AI labs have faced significant challenges in breaking into the top tier, with established entities like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind dominating the landscape. The analysis suggests a low base rate for new entrants, with forecasts estimating around 5.39 "frontier" AI labs by late 2025, indicating limited turnover among the top labs. The competitive environment is characterized by high resource and talent demands, creating substantial barriers to entry for new labs.

The research further discusses the forces at play, distinguishing between status quo forces that favor established players and change drivers that could enable new labs to emerge. While there is potential for innovation and increased investment to foster new entrants, evidence supporting significant disruption remains scarce. Recent updates confirm the dominance of existing labs, with no new entrants post-2024 projected to reach the top 5 within two years. The study also notes that the criteria for defining a "leading lab" may be overly narrow, focusing solely on Chatbot Arena ELO, and acknowledges the possibility of unforeseen breakthroughs from emerging labs, despite historical trends suggesting otherwise.

### Research Summary
The research examines the potential for major labor strikes in the U.S. in 2029 that cite generative AI as a primary reason. It establishes criteria for what constitutes a major labor strike, noting that such strikes must involve over 1,000 workers and last at least one shift, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The SAG-AFTRA video game strike from 2024-2025 is highlighted as a reference point for AI-related labor disputes, indicating a trend where unions are increasingly incorporating AI-related demands into their negotiations, although this does not always result in strikes.

The research contrasts the forces maintaining the status quo, such as employer resistance to broad AI protections, with change drivers like rising concerns over job displacement due to generative AI, which are prompting unions to seek explicit protections. However, as of August 2025, there are no major labor strikes reported for 2029 that involve generative AI as a primary demand, suggesting either successful negotiations or a lack of urgency among unions regarding AI protections. The study emphasizes the importance of credible sources confirming AI as a main reason for any strikes, as misclassification could occur if AI is considered a secondary issue.

Sources used in the research include the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and other credible sources for labor strike information.


# RESEARCH
## Report 1 Research
### 1) Base Rates & Reference Class
- Major labor strikes in the US require 1,000+ workers and must last at least one shift to be counted by the BLS.
- The SAG-AFTRA video game strike (2024-2025) serves as a reference for AI-related labor disputes.
- Increasing trend of unions incorporating AI-related demands into negotiations, though not always leading to strikes.

### 2) Status Quo Forces vs Change Drivers
- **Status Quo Forces:** Employers often resist broad AI protections, leading to stalled negotiations.
- **Change Drivers:** Rising concerns about job displacement due to generative AI, prompting unions to demand explicit protections in contracts.

### 3) Most Recent Credible Updates WITH DATES (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **2025-06-01:** Tentative agreement reached in SAG-AFTRA video game strike, including AI protections.
- **2025-08-01:** No major labor strikes reported for 2029 involving generative AI as a primary demand, per BLS and credible sources.

### 4) Resolution Criteria Traps & Fine-Print Gotchas
- Strikes must have generative AI as a primary demand to qualify under BLS criteria.
- Credible sources must confirm AI as a main reason for the strike; otherwise, it may not be counted.
- Potential for misclassification of strikes if AI is a secondary issue rather than a primary demand.

### 5) Disconfirming Evidence (Steelman)
- As of August 2025, there are no documented major labor strikes for 2029 involving generative AI as a primary demand.
- The absence of strikes could indicate successful negotiations or a lack of urgency among unions regarding AI protections.
- Historical context shows that while AI is a growing concern, it has not yet catalyzed significant labor actions in 2029.

- 10th percentile: 0
- 25th percentile: 1
- 50th percentile: 2
- 75th percentile: 3
- 90th percentile: 5
- 99th percentile: 7

### Bayesian Block
- **Base Rate:** Historically, major labor strikes in the US are relatively rare, with a few dozen occurring annually across all industries. AI-related strikes are a new phenomenon with limited historical data.

- **Likelihoods:**
- **Status Quo Forces:** Employers' resistance to AI-related demands could limit the number of strikes.
- **Change Drivers:** Increasing union concerns about AI could lead to more strikes, but the extent is uncertain.

- **Parametric Proposal:**
```xml
<family>lognormal</family>
<params>meanlog=0.5, sdlog=0.7</params>
```

### Rationale
- **Base Rate & Reference Class:** The base rate for major strikes is low, and AI-related strikes are even less frequent. The 2024-2025 SAG-AFTRA strike serves as a key reference point.
- **Status Quo vs Change Drivers:** While there is a growing trend of AI-related demands, it is unclear how many will escalate to strikes by 2029.
- **Recent Updates & Disconfirming Evidence:** As of mid-2025, no major strikes for 2029 have been reported with AI as a primary demand, suggesting a cautious approach to forecasting higher numbers.
- **Resolution Criteria & Gotchas:** Strikes must have AI as a primary demand, which could limit the number of qualifying events. Misclassification risks also exist if AI is not the main issue.

### BAYESIAN Block
- **Base Rate:** Historically, major labor strikes in the US number around 20-25 per year, but those with AI as a primary demand are rare.
- **Likelihoods:**
- Increasing union awareness and negotiation around AI issues.
- Employers' resistance to broad AI protections may lead to more strikes.
- Recent agreements show potential for successful negotiations without strikes.
- **Parametric Proposal:**
- <family>lognormal</family>
- <params>meanlog=0.7, sdlog=0.5</params>

### Rationale
- **Base Rates & Reference Class:** The base rate for major strikes is low, and AI-related demands are a subset of these.
- **Status Quo vs Change Drivers:** While there is a growing trend of AI-related demands, successful negotiations could prevent strikes.
- **Recent Updates:** As of mid-2025, no strikes for 2029 have been reported, suggesting a low likelihood but not ruling out future occurrences.
- **Resolution Criteria & Disconfirming Evidence:** The requirement for AI to be a primary demand and the absence of current reports suggest a conservative estimate.

- 99th percentile: 7

### Bayesian Block
- **Base Rate:** Historically, major labor strikes in the US are relatively rare, with a few dozen occurring annually across all issues. AI-related strikes are a new phenomenon, with only a few recorded so far.
- **Likelihoods:**
- **Status Quo Forces:** Employers' resistance to AI protections could limit the number of strikes.
- **Change Drivers:** Growing concerns about AI-related job displacement and increasing union demands for AI protections suggest potential for more strikes.
- **Parametric Proposal:**
- <family>Poisson</family>
- <params>Œª=2</params>

### Rationale
The forecast reflects the early stage of AI-related labor disputes, with only a few strikes having occurred so far. Given the increasing trend of unions incorporating AI demands, it's reasonable to expect some growth in the number of strikes by 2029. However, significant uncertainty remains, as evidenced by the wide range of percentiles. The Poisson distribution is chosen due to its suitability for modeling count data, with a mean (Œª) reflecting the expected number of strikes based on current trends and uncertainties.

- **25th percentile:** 1
- **50th percentile:** 2
- **75th percentile:** 3
- **90th percentile:** 5
- **99th percentile:** 7

### Bayesian Block

- **Base Rate:** Historically, major labor strikes involving new technology concerns have been rare, but the increasing trend of AI-related demands suggests a modest base rate of around 1-2 strikes per year involving generative AI as a primary demand by 2029.

- **Likelihoods:**
- **Increase in AI-related demands:** Likely to increase the number of strikes, but not all negotiations will lead to strikes.
- **Employer resistance:** Could stall negotiations, potentially leading to more strikes.
- **Successful negotiations:** May prevent some strikes from occurring.

- **Parametric Proposal:**
- **<family>lognormal</family>**
- **<params>meanlog = 0.7, sdlog = 0.5</params>**

This proposal reflects a skewed distribution with a heavier tail on the higher end, acknowledging the uncertainty and potential for a few more strikes than historical norms due to the increasing relevance of AI-related issues.
