Pythia Non-Commercial Public License
Version 1.0

Copyright (c) 2025 Kevin Wyjad

1. Definitions

1.1. "Software" means the Pythia codebase and any associated files
distributed by the Licensor under this License, including any
modifications or derivative works made by you or others.

1.2. "Licensor" means Kevin Wyjad.

1.3. "You" (or "your") means any person or entity exercising rights
under this License.

1.4. "Non-Commercial Use" means any use of the Software that:

    (a) is not intended for or directed toward commercial advantage
        or monetary compensation; and

    (b) does not involve, and is not intended to lead to, the
        development, operation, or enhancement of a product or
        service that is offered for sale, license, subscription,
        paid consulting, or other commercial benefit.

    Non-Commercial Use specifically includes, for example:

        • academic research, teaching, student projects, and
          publications conducted by universities and other
          not-for-profit educational institutions;

        • internal use by United Nations entities, intergovernmental
          organizations, and international financial institutions
          (including, without limitation, the World Bank Group,
          regional development banks, and UN specialized agencies)
          where such use supports their public-interest, development,
          or humanitarian mandates and is not carried out for profit;

        • internal use by non-profit, charitable, or humanitarian
          organizations (including NGOs, Red Cross / Red Crescent
          societies, and similar) in support of public-interest or
          humanitarian programmes;

        • internal use by public-sector institutions and government
          agencies in support of non-commercial public policy,
          preparedness, or humanitarian activities;

        • personal learning, experimentation, and non-commercial
          research by individuals.

    The fact that a user or organization has a budget, receives
    grants or public funding, or pays salaries does not by itself
    make a use "Commercial". The key question is whether the Software
    is being used to deliver or support a product or service that is
    sold or otherwise monetized, or to generate profit or commercial
    competitive advantage.

1.5. "Commercial Use" means any use of the Software that is not
Non-Commercial Use, including (without limitation):

    (a) using the Software, or a work based on it, as part of any
        product or service that is sold, licensed, or otherwise
        monetized, whether directly (e.g. a paid software product,
        SaaS platform, API, or data service) or indirectly (e.g.
        bundled into a paid consulting engagement);

    (b) using the Software to deliver, support, or enhance consulting,
        integration, analytics, or other professional services for
        which fees are charged, including when the main sale is a
        service contract rather than the Software itself;

    (c) using the Software in systems whose primary purpose is to
        generate revenue, reduce commercial costs, or provide
        competitive advantage for a for-profit business, including
        internal tools used to support commercial operations.

If you are unsure whether your use is Commercial Use, you must treat
it as Commercial Use and seek a separate written license from the
Licensor at: kevin.wyjad@gmail

1.6. "Modified Version" means any work that is based on or derived
from the Software under applicable copyright law, including any
modifications, translations, adaptations, or combinations with other
code, other than mere aggregation on a storage or distribution
medium.


2. Grant of License for Non-Commercial Use

Subject to your full compliance with this License, the Licensor grants
you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, solely for
Non-Commercial Use, to:

    (a) use and run the Software;
    (b) reproduce the Software;
    (c) create Modified Versions of the Software; and
    (d) distribute the Software and Modified Versions, in source or
        object form, to third parties, under the conditions set out
        below.


3. Copyleft and Source-Code Availability

3.1. Same License. If you distribute the Software or any Modified
Version to any third party in any form (including as part of a hosted
service that is accessible outside your organization), you must
license the entire work that is based on the Software under this same
License. You may not add terms that further restrict the rights
granted by this License.

3.2. Source Code. If you distribute the Software or a Modified
Version, you must make the complete corresponding source code of the
distributed version available to all recipients, at no charge beyond
reasonable costs of distribution (if any). This source code must be
provided under this same License.

3.3. Notices. You must:

    (a) retain all copyright notices, attributions, and references
        to this License in the Software and any Modified Version;

    (b) clearly mark any files you have changed with a notice of
        your changes and the date of change; and

    (c) acknowledge the original project in documentation or
        notices as follows (or in a substantially similar form):

        "This work is based on Pythia, developed by Kevin Wyjad
        and contributors."

3.4. Mere Aggregation. Merely aggregating the Software with separate
and independent works on a storage or distribution medium, without
combining or integrating them into a single program, does not create
a Modified Version and does not subject those separate works to this
License.


4. Commercial Use Requires Separate Agreement

4.1. No Commercial Rights. This License does not grant you any rights
to Commercial Use of the Software or any Modified Version. All
Commercial Use is expressly excluded from the scope of this License.

4.2. Separate Commercial License. Any Commercial Use of the Software
or a Modified Version requires a separate written agreement signed by
the Licensor. For commercial licensing inquiries, contact:

    kevin.wyjad@gmail

4.3. Breach. Any Commercial Use of the Software or a Modified Version
without such a separate written agreement constitutes a material
breach of this License and automatically terminates your rights under
this License.


5. Contributions and Patents

5.1. Contributions. If you submit code or other material to the
Licensor for inclusion in the Software ("Contributions"), you grant
the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free
license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute your Contributions
as part of the Software under this License and any future versions
or alternative licenses that the Licensor may adopt.

5.2. Patent Grant (Non-Commercial Only). To the extent you own or
control patent claims that would be infringed by your Contributions
alone or by their combination with the Software, you grant to the
Licensor and all recipients of the Software a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, royalty-free license to practice those patent claims
solely as necessary to use, modify, and distribute the Software for
Non-Commercial Use under this License.

5.3. Patent Retaliation. If you initiate patent litigation alleging
that the Software or a Modified Version infringes a patent, your
rights under this License terminate immediately.


6. Trademarks

This License does not grant you any rights in any names, logos, or
trademarks of the Licensor or the Pythia project.


7. Warranty Disclaimer

The Software is provided "as is". To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, the Licensor makes no representations or warranties
of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to any
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
non-infringement, or that the Software will be error-free or secure.
You use the Software at your own risk.


8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will
the Licensor or any contributor be liable for any indirect, special,
incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data,
profits, or revenue, arising out of or in connection with the use of
or inability to use the Software, even if advised of the possibility
of such damages. Any direct liability shall be limited to the amount,
if any, you paid to the Licensor for a license to use the Software. 
Use at your own risk. This is experimental forecasting software. It 
does not give god-like views of the future. It might be absolute rubbish.
Probably its wrong most of the time. Use some common sense. 


9. Termination

9.1. Automatic Termination. This License terminates automatically if
you fail to comply with any of its terms.

9.2. Effect of Termination. Upon termination, you must cease all use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Software and any Modified
Versions. Termination does not affect the rights of any third parties
who received the Software or Modified Versions from you, provided
they remain in full compliance with this License.

9.3. Reinstatement. The Licensor may, at their sole discretion, offer
to reinstate your rights under this License if you cure the breach
within a reasonable time.


10. Miscellaneous

10.1. Severability. If any provision of this License is held
unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force
and effect.

10.2. Governing Law. This License is governed by the laws of
[TBD JURISDICTION], excluding its conflict-of-law rules. If you do
not specify a jurisdiction, the laws of the Licensor’s country of
residence at the time of distribution shall apply.

10.3. New Versions. The Licensor may publish new versions of this
License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
version number. You may continue to use any version you originally
received, or you may choose to adopt a later version published by the
Licensor.


11. Collaboration and Contact

11.1. Collaboration Interest. The Licensor is particularly interested
in collaboration with:

    • United Nations entities and other multilateral organizations
      working on humanitarian action, anticipatory action, and risk
      analysis;

    • international financial institutions (including multilateral
      development banks) exploring risk-informed financing,
      preparedness, and anticipatory instruments;

    • non-governmental organizations and other humanitarian actors
      using forecasting or risk analytics for preparedness and
      response; and

    • academic researchers working on forecasting, humanitarian data,
      and related fields.

11.2. Contact. If you are using Pythia in academic, humanitarian, or
public-interest projects, or are interested in joint work, research,

required) to contact the Licensor at:

This section is intended to encourage collaboration and does not
create additional legal obligations beyond those elsewhere in this
License.
